<p class="plabeln"><span class="smcap">Speech in the Senate, on the Contested Election of Hon. John
P. Stockton, of New Jersey, March 23, 1866.</span></p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/line.png" width="80" height="16" alt="" />
</div>

<div class="medium">

<p>The seat of Hon. John P. Stockton, as Senator from New Jersey,
was contested at this session of the Senate, on the ground of irregularity
in the election. The Judiciary Committee, by their Chairman,
Mr. Trumbull, reported that he “was duly elected, and is entitled to
his seat,” and in their report stated the case:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“The only question involved in the decision of Mr. Stockton’s right to a
seat is, whether an election by a plurality of votes of the members of the
Legislature of New Jersey, in joint meeting assembled, in pursuance of a
rule adopted by the joint meeting itself, is valid. The protestants insist
that it is not; and they deny Mr. Stockton’s right to a seat, because, as they
say, he was not appointed by a majority of the votes of the joint meeting of
the Legislature.”</p>

</div>

<p>The debate on this question showed earnestness and feeling. Mr.
Fessenden, of Maine, used strong language: “I was exceedingly surprised&mdash;more
so, I will say, than I ever was before, at a judicial decision,
in my life&mdash;at the opinion to which the Committee on the Judiciary
arrived in relation to this matter.” Mr. Trumbull defended the
report. Mr. Sumner followed.</p>

</div>

<p class="dropcap">MR. PRESIDENT,&mdash;When the Senator from Illinois
rose to speak, I had made up my mind to
say nothing in this debate; but topics have been introduced
by him which I am unwilling should pass without
notice.</p>

<p>The Senator did not disguise that the case is without<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[Pg 2]</a></span>
a precedent in the history of the Senate. Never
before has a Senator appeared in this Chamber with
the credentials of a minority. And I venture to say
further, that the rule of a majority has the constant
consecration of history in the proceedings of parliamentary
or electoral bodies. It is the rule of the
House of Commons in the choice of Speaker; and this
is the most important precedent for us, for our Parliamentary
Law is derived from England. But it antedates
the English Parliament. The oldest electoral
body in the world is the Conclave of Cardinals; but
who has heard that a Pope was ever elected by a minority?
I ask your attention to this example, that
you may see how the rule of the minority is constantly
rejected, notwithstanding temptation, inducement, and
pressure to adopt it. There have been many contested
elections, during which the Cardinals, separated from
the world, each in a small apartment or cell of the
Vatican or the Palace of the Quirinal, have been imprisoned
like a jury, sometimes for months, waiting
for the requisite majority. They did not undertake to
change the rule, and set up the will of a minority.
There was Lambertini, who shone as Pope Benedict
the Fourteenth, conspicuous as statesman and patron
of letters, who was not chosen until after six months’
ineffectual efforts. Such instances stand like so many
pillars, and I refer to them now as proper to guide your
conduct.</p>

<p>The question before us is of law, and nothing else.
It is not a question of politics or of sentiment, except
so far as these enter into the determination of law.
It is a question for reason alone.</p>

<p>It lies in a nutshell. A brief text of the National<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[Pg 3]</a></span>
Constitution, and another brief text of a local statute,
are all that need be considered.</p>

<p>The National Constitution provides as follows:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“The Senate of the United States shall be composed of
two Senators from each State, chosen by the <em>Legislature</em>
thereof.”</p>

<p>“The times, places, and <em>manner of holding elections for
Senators</em> and Representatives shall be <em>prescribed</em> in each
State by the <em>Legislature</em> thereof; but the Congress may
at any time by law make or alter such regulations, except
as to the places of choosing Senators.”</p>

</div>

<p>In carrying out this provision, the Legislature of New
Jersey, by a statute passed April 10, 1846, and copied
from a statute passed in 1790, enacted as follows:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“Senators of the United States on the part of this State
shall be appointed <em>by the Senate and General Assembly of
this State in joint meeting assembled</em>.”</p>

</div>

<p>In pursuance of these two provisions of National
Constitution and of local statute, the Legislature of
New Jersey has undertaken to elect a Senator. From
the statement of the case, it appears, that, on a certain
day, the two Houses assembled “in joint meeting”;
that they proceeded to act on a resolution declaring
that “any candidate receiving a <em>plurality</em> of votes of the
members present shall be declared duly elected”; that
this resolution was adopted by forty-one votes out of
eighty-one,&mdash;eleven Senators, being a majority of the
Senate, and thirty members of the House, being less
than a majority of that body, voting for it; that, in pursuance
of this resolution, Mr. Stockton was declared
Senator, although he did not receive a majority of the
votes of either House or of the joint meeting. In<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[Pg 4]</a></span>
point of fact, he received forty votes, of which ten
were from Senators and thirty from members of the
Assembly, while against him were forty-one votes;
and the question you are to decide is on the legality
of this election.</p>

<p>The National Constitution is the original and highest
source of light on the question. Here we find, that,
in the absence of any regulations from Congress, the
manner of choosing a Senator is referred to the State
Legislature. The Senator is to be chosen by the <em>Legislature</em>,
which is to <em>prescribe</em>, among other things, the
<em>manner</em> of holding the election. Whatever the State
can do must be derived from this source, nor more nor
less. The choice is by the Legislature, according to a
manner prescribed by the Legislature.</p>

<p>The National Constitution does not undertake to define
a State Legislature or its forms of proceeding.
This is left to the State itself. Notoriously, these Legislatures
were modelled on the Colonial Legislatures preceding
them, which had been modelled on the Parliament
of the mother country. As a general rule, there
were two Chambers, upper and lower; but this was
not universal. In Georgia and Pennsylvania there was
for a while only a single Chamber, constituting the
Legislature. I mention this to show how completely
the State itself was left to determine the conditions
of its Legislature. But the State speaks through the
State Constitution, which fixes these conditions. Where
the Constitution is silent, can the Legislature itself venture
to speak?</p>

<p>Repairing to the Constitution of New Jersey, we find
it providing that “the <em>legislative power</em> shall be vested
in a Senate and General Assembly”; that these bodies<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[Pg 5]</a></span>
shall meet and organize separately”; that “all bills
and joint resolutions shall be read three times in each
House”; and “no bill or joint resolution shall pass,
unless there be a <em>majority</em> of all the members of each
body personally present and agreeing thereto.” Such
is the definition of a Legislature, and such are the
forms of legislative proceedings prescribed by the Constitution
of New Jersey.</p>

<p>The statute of New Jersey, to which I have referred
as framed in 1790, was entitled “An Act to <em>prescribe
the manner</em> of appointing Senators of the United States
and Electors of the President and Vice-President of the
United States on the part of this State.” This was in
pursuance of the National Constitution. It was the
execution, on the part of the State, of the power with
which it was invested to prescribe the manner of electing
Senators.</p>

<p>I have no purpose of raising any question with regard
to the validity of this statute prescribing the election
of Senators <em>in joint meeting</em>. Constant usage is in
its favor; and yet I have no hesitation in saying that
it has always seemed to me inconsistent with a just
construction of the National Constitution. Senators are
to be “chosen by the Legislature”; but the Legislature
is composed of two separate bodies, defined by the State
Constitution. Senators, therefore, should be chosen by
the two bodies separately. So it has always seemed to
me, and the practice of my own State is accordingly.
In this opinion I am sustained by so eminent an authority
as Chancellor Kent, who, after setting forth the
usage, proceeds to express his dissent from it as a just
construction of the National Constitution. His language
is explicit:&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[Pg 6]</a></span></p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“I should think, if the question was a new one, that,
when the Constitution directed that the Senators should
be chosen by <em>the Legislature</em>, it meant, not the members of
the Legislature <i>per capita</i>, but the Legislature in the true
technical sense, being the two Houses acting in their separate
and organized capacities, with the ordinary constitutional
right of negative on each other’s proceedings.”<a name="FNanchor_1_1" id="FNanchor_1_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a></p>

</div>

<p>It is difficult to resist this conclusion, especially when
it is considered that in any other way the smaller body
is actually swamped by the larger. In a joint meeting
the Senate loses its relative power. I adduce this, not
for criticism, but only for illustration. Even admitting
that the received usage of choosing Senators in joint
meeting is consistent with the National Constitution,
it is clear that it should not be extended; and this
is the precise question before us. Contrary to all usage
or precedent, and without any direct sanction in the
Constitution or statutes of New Jersey, the Legislature
has undertaken in joint meeting, not only to choose a
Senator, but also to prescribe the manner of choosing
him. Finding that it could not choose according to
existing usage, it adopted the resolution declaring that
the election should be determined by a minority of
votes instead of a majority.</p>

<p>In this resolution two questions arise: first, can the
Legislature itself, by legislative act, substitute a minority
for a majority in the election of Senators, and
thus set aside a great and traditional principle? and,
secondly, can it do this in a “joint meeting,” without
any previous legislative act? It is enough for the
present occasion, if I show, that, whatever may be the
powers of the Legislature by legislative act, it can have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[Pg 7]</a></span>
no such extraordinary power in the questionable assembly
known as “joint meeting.” But we shall better
understand the second question, after considering
the first.</p>

<p>To what extent can a Legislature substitute a minority
for a majority in any of its proceedings? In
most cases the question is controlled by the express
language of the State Constitution; but I present
the question now independently of any State Constitution.</p>

<p>In considering the power of the Legislature, it is
important to put aside any influence that may be attributed
to the unquestioned usage of choosing Representatives
and other officers by plurality of votes. Because
the people choose by plurality, it does not follow
that a Legislature may. From time immemorial, the
rule in the two cases has been different, unless we except
the New England States, where, until recently, even
popular elections were by a majority. But the origin of
the practice in New England testifies to the rule.</p>

<p>It is proper for us to interrogate the country from
which our institutions are derived, for the origin of
the rule. Indeed, where a word is used in the Constitution
having a previous signification or character
in the institutions of England, we cannot err, if we
consider its import there. I think we do this habitually.
Mr. Wirt, in his masterly argument on the impeachment
of Judge Peck, develops this idea.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“The Constitution secures the trial by jury. Where do
you get the meaning of <em>a trial by jury</em>? Certainly not from
the Civil or Canon Law, or the Law of Nations. It is peculiar
to the Common Law; and to the Common Law, therefore,
the Constitution itself refers you for a description and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[Pg 8]</a></span>
explanation of this high privilege, <em>the trial by jury</em>, and <em>the
mode of proceeding</em> in those trials.… The very name by
which it is called into being authorizes it to look at once to
the English archetypes for its government.”<a name="FNanchor_2_2" id="FNanchor_2_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a></p>

</div>

<p>Following this statement, so clearly expressed, the
words “Legislature” and “holding elections,” in the
National Constitution, which belonged to the political
system of England, may be explained by that system,&mdash;so,
at least, that in case of doubt we shall find light in
this quarter.</p>

<p>Now, from the beginning, it appears that in England
there have been two different rules with regard to
elections by the legislature and elections by the people.
Elections by the legislature, like legislative acts, have
been by majority; elections by the people for Parliament
have been by plurality. This distinction is found
throughout English history.</p>

<p>The House of Commons chooses its Speaker by majority.
It may be said, also, that it chooses the Ministers
of the Crown in the same way, because the
fate of a cabinet depends upon a majority. In short,
whatever it does, unless it be the nomination of committees,
is by majority. It is only through majority
that it can act. The House of Commons itself is
found in the majority of its members,&mdash;never in a
minority.</p>

<p>On the other hand, members of Parliament are chosen
by plurality. No reason is assigned for the difference;
but it may be found, perhaps, in two considerations:
first, the superior convenience, amounting almost to necessity,
of choosing members of Parliament in this way;
and, secondly, the fact that popular bodies were not embraced<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[Pg 9]</a></span>
by the Law of Corporations, which establishes
the rule of the majority.</p>

<p>Here I adduce the authority of Mr. Cushing, in his
Parliamentary Law, in the very passage cited by the
Senator from Illinois:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“At the time of the first settlement and colonization of
the United States, the elections of members of Parliament
in England were conducted upon the principle of plurality,
which also prevailed in all other elections in which the electors
were at liberty to select their candidates from an indefinite
number of qualified persons. Such has been, and
still continues to be, the Common Law of England; and
such is the present practice in that country in all elections.”<a name="FNanchor_3_3" id="FNanchor_3_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a></p>

</div>

<p>It will be perceived that this statement is with reference
to popular elections, and not elections by corporate
or legislative bodies. So far as it goes, it is explicit.
But pardon me, if I say that the Senator from
Illinois has misunderstood it. Had he examined it
carefully, he would have seen that it had no bearing
on the present case. Nobody questions the plurality
rule in the election of members of Congress, although
few, perhaps, have considered how it came into existence.
Mr. Cushing, whom the Senator cites, explains
it, and in a way to furnish no authority for a minority
instead of a majority in a legislative body. The rule
prevailed in England. The colonies of Virginia and
New York adopted it. From these, as they became
States, it gradually extended throughout the country.
A different rule was carried to New England by the
Puritan Fathers. Even popular elections were by the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[Pg 10]</a></span>
rule of the majority, as is explained by the same
learned authority.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“The charter of the Colony of the Massachusetts Bay
being that of a trading company, and not municipal in its
character, the officers of the Colony were originally chosen
at general meetings of the whole body of freemen, precisely
as at the present day the directors of a business corporation,
a bank, for example, are chosen by the stockholders
at a general meeting. In the choice of Assistants, who
were to be eighteen in number, at these meetings of the
Company, or, as they were called, Courts of Election, the
practice seems to have been for the names of the candidates
to be regularly moved and seconded, and put to the question,
one by one, in the same manner with all other motions.
This was then, as it is now, the mode of proceeding
in England, in the election of the Speaker of the House of
Commons, and in the appointment of committees of the
House, when they are not chosen by ballot. Probably, also,
it was the usual mode of proceeding in electing the officers
of a private corporation or company. In voting upon the
names thus proposed, it was ordered&mdash;with a view, doubtless,
to secure the independence and impartiality of the
electors&mdash;that the freemen, instead of giving an affirmative
or negative voice in the usual open and visible manner,
should give their suffrages by ballot, and for that purpose
should ‘use Indian corn and beans: the Indian corn
to manifest election, the beans contrary.’ The names of the
candidates being thus moved and voted upon, each by itself,
it followed, of course, that no person could be elected but
by an absolute majority.”<a name="FNanchor_4_4" id="FNanchor_4_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a></p>

</div>

<p>The rule, thus curiously explained, continued in
Massachusetts down to a recent day; at last it yielded<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[Pg 11]</a></span>
to the exigency of public convenience, so that at this
moment, I believe, popular elections throughout the
United States are by the plurality rule. But I repeat,
that this is no authority for overturning the rule of the
majority in a legislative body, having in its favor so
many reasons of law and tradition.</p>

<p>I have only alluded to the Law of Corporations; but
this law is of weight in determining the present case.
According to this law, the rule of the majority must
prevail. Indeed, an eminent jurist says that this rule
is according to the Law of Nature, as it is unquestionably
according to the Roman Law, and the modern law
of civilized states.<a name="FNanchor_5_5" id="FNanchor_5_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a> But what is a legislative body but
a political corporation? Therefore, when asked if a
Legislature, even by legislative act, may set aside the
rule of the majority in the election of Senators, I must
candidly express a doubt. The Constitution confides
this power to the “Legislature”; but the “Legislature”
consists of a majority. <i>Ubi major pars est, ibi
totum</i>: “Where the greater part is, there is the whole.”
Such is an approved maxim of the law; and this maxim
has in its support, first, the Law of Nature, secondly,
the Law of Corporations, thirdly, the Parliamentary
Law, and, fourthly, the principles of republican government.
Who ever thought of saying, Where the minority
is, there is the whole?</p>

<p>But we are not asked now to decide the question,
whether the Legislature, by legislative act, may substitute
the rule of a minority for the majority. That
question is not necessarily before us. In the present
case there has been no legislative act; and the question
is, whether the rule of the minority may be substituted<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</a></span>
for the majority by the abnormal body known
as joint meeting. On this point the conclusion is clear.
Even assuming that this substitution may be made by
legislative act, it does not follow that it may be made
in joint meeting.</p>

<p>Surely, such a change is of immense gravity, and
should be made only under all possible solemnities and
safeguards. If ever there was occasion for the delays
and precautions provided by legislative proceedings, with
three different readings in each separate House, it must
be when such a change is in question. Such surely is
the suggestion of reason. But the Constitution itself,
which delegates to the “Legislature” of each State the
power to <em>prescribe the manner</em> of electing Senators, uses
language not open to evasion. This power is to be exercised
by the “Legislature,” which may prescribe the
manner. It is not to be exercised by any other body
than the Legislature; and the manner is to be prescribed
by the Legislature. But, assuming that it may
be exercised in joint meeting, it is clear that this must
be in pursuance of some legislative act, prescribing in
advance the manner.</p>

<p>Supposing the case doubtful, then I submit that all
presumptions and interpretations must tend to support
the rule of a majority. In other words, so important
a rule, having its foundation in the Law of Nature, the
Law of Corporations, Parliamentary Law, and the principles
of republican institutions, cannot be set aside
without the plainest and most positive intendment. It
cannot be done by inference or construction. If ever
there was occasion where every doubt was to be counted
against the assumption of power, it is the present. I
know very little of cards, but I remember a rule of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[Pg 13]</a></span>
Hoyle, “When you are in doubt, take the trick.” Just
the reverse must be done in a case like the present,
involving so important a principle: when you are in
doubt, do not take the trick. This is a republican government,
and surely you will not abandon the first principle
of a republican government without good reason.
According to received maxims of law, you must always
incline in favor of Liberty. In the same spirit you
must always incline in favor of every principle of republican
government, and especially of that vital principle
which establishes the rule of the majority. Thus
inclining, the way at present is easy; and here I quote
another authority, very different from Hoyle. Lord Bacon,
in his Maxims of the Law, after mentioning a similar
presumption, says:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“It is a rule drawn out of the depths of reason.…
It makes an end of many questions and doubts about construction
of words: for, if the labor were only to pick out
the intention of the parties, every judge would have a several
sense; <em>whereas this rule doth give them a sway to take
the law more certainly one way</em>.”<a name="FNanchor_6_6" id="FNanchor_6_6"></a><a href="#Footnote_6_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a></p>

</div>

<p>And now, Sir, I have only to add, in conclusion, let
us incline in favor of the rule of the majority. So inclining,
you will at once show reverence for the republican
principle and will stand on the ancient ways.</p>

<div class="medium">

<p>The question was then taken on an amendment, moved by Mr.
Clark, of New Hampshire, to insert the word “not” before the word
“duly” in the resolution of the Committee, and also before the word
“entitled,” so that it should read that he “was not duly elected, and
is not entitled to his seat.” This amendment was lost,&mdash;Yeas 19,
Nays 21. The question then recurred on the resolution of the Committee.
Upon the conclusion of the calling of the roll, the vote stood,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</a></span>
Yeas 21, Nays 20, when Mr. Morrill, of Maine, said, “Call my name.”
This was done, and he said, “I vote nay.” Mr. Stockton, who had
not voted, rose, and, after stating that his colleague, Mr. Wright, was
at home, said, “When he was last in this Chamber, he told me, as
he left the Hall, that he would not go home, if it were not for the fact
that he had paired off with the Senator from Maine. Mr. President,
I ask that my name be called.” His name was then called, and he
voted in the affirmative, so that the result was, Yeas 22, Nays 21.
Meanwhile Mr. Morrill stated the circumstances with regard to his
original pair with Mr. Wright and his withdrawal from it. The result
was then declared,&mdash;Yeas 22, Nays 21,&mdash;making a majority in
the affirmative, and the resolution was treated as adopted.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The sequel of these proceedings, ending in the passage of a resolution,
moved by Mr. Sumner, “that the vote of Mr. Stockton be not
received,” and the adoption of a resolution declaring him “not entitled
to a seat as Senator,” will appear under the next article.</p>

<p class="plabeln"><span class="smcap">Speech in the Senate, on the Vote of Hon. John P. Stockton

<div class="medium">

<p>March 26th, immediately after the reading of the Senate journal,
Mr. Sumner rose to what he called a question of privilege, and moved
“that the journal of Friday, March 23, 1866, be amended by striking
out the vote of Mr. Stockton on the question of his right to a seat in
the Senate.” The circumstances of this vote appear at the close of
the last article. On his motion Mr. Sumner said:&mdash;</p>

</div>

<p class="dropcap">There are two ways, I believe, if there are not
three, but there are certainly two ways of meeting
the question presented by the vote of Mr. Stockton.
I use his name directly, because it will be plainer
and I shall be more easily understood. I say there are
two ways in which the case may be met. One is, by
motion to disallow the vote; the other, by motion, such
as I have made, to amend the journal. Perhaps a third
way, though not so satisfactory to my mind, would be
by motion to reconsider; but I am not in a condition
to make this motion, as I did not vote with the apparent
majority. I call your attention, however, at the
outset, to two ways,&mdash;one by disallowing the vote, and
the other by amending the journal. But behind both,
or all three, arises the simple question, Had Mr. Stockton
a right to vote? To this it is replied, that his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</a></span>
name was on the roll of the Senate, and accordingly
was called by our Secretary; to which I answer,&mdash;and
to my mind the answer is complete,&mdash;The rule of
the Senate must be construed always in subordination
to the principles of Natural Law and Parliamentary
Law, and therefore you are brought again to the question
with which I began, Had Mr. Stockton a right to
vote?</p>

<p>Had he a right to vote, first, according to the principles
of Natural Law, or, in other words, the principles
of Universal Law? I take it there is no lawyer, there
is no man even of the most moderate reading, who is
not familiar with the principle of jurisprudence, recognized
in all countries and in all ages, that no man can
be a judge in his own case. That principle has been
reduced to form among the maxims of our Common
Law,&mdash;<i>Nemo debet esse judex in propria sua causa</i>. As
such it has been handed down from the earliest days
of the mother country. It was brought here by our
fathers, and has been cherished sacredly by us as a
cardinal rule in every court of justice. No judge, no
tribunal, high or low, can undertake to set aside this
rule. I have in my hand the most recent work on
the Maxims of Law, where, after quoting this rule, the
learned writer says:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“It is a fundamental rule in the administration of justice,
that a person cannot be judge in a cause wherein he
is interested.”<a name="FNanchor_7_7" id="FNanchor_7_7"></a><a href="#Footnote_7_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a></p>

</div>

<p>In another place, the same learned writer says:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“It is, then, a rule always observed in practice, and of
the application of which instances not unfrequently occur<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[Pg 17]</a></span>
that, where a judge is interested in the result of a cause,
he cannot, either personally or by deputy, sit in judgment
upon it.”<a name="FNanchor_8_8" id="FNanchor_8_8"></a><a href="#Footnote_8_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a></p>

</div>

<p>This rule had its earliest and most authoritative judicial
statement in an opinion by an eminent judge of
England, who has always been quoted for integrity in
times when integrity was rare: I mean Chief Justice
Hobart, of the Court of Common Pleas. In his own
Reports, cited as Hobart’s Reports, I call attention to
the case of <i>Day</i> v. <i>Savadge</i>, where this learned magistrate
said:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“It was against right and justice, and against natural
equity, to allow them [the Mayor and Aldermen of London]
their certificate, wherein they are to try and judge
their own cause.”</p>

</div>

<p class="noindent">And then he says, in memorable language, which has
made his name famous:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“Even an Act of Parliament, made against natural equity,
as, to make a man judge in his own case, is void in
itself; for <i>jura naturæ sunt immutabilia</i>, and they are <i>leges
legum</i>.”<a name="FNanchor_9_9" id="FNanchor_9_9"></a><a href="#Footnote_9_9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a></p>

</div>

<p>Thus strongly and completely did he cover the present
case, reaching forward with judgment. According
to him, even an Act of Parliament making a man judge
in his own case is void. But, Sir, he was not alone.
His great contemporary, and our teacher at this hour,
Sir Edward Coke, in a very famous case, known as <i>Bonham’s</i>,
which I have not before me now, but which is
referred to in other cases, lays down the same rule,&mdash;that
a court of justice will not even recognize an Act<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</a></span>
of Parliament, if it undertakes to make a man judge in
his own case.<a name="FNanchor_10_10" id="FNanchor_10_10"></a><a href="#Footnote_10_10" class="fnanchor">[10]</a></p>

<p>But another judge, who, as lawyer and authority in
courts down to this day, perhaps excels even the two
already cited,&mdash;I mean Lord Chief Justice Holt,&mdash;has
explained and developed this principle in masterly
language. I refer to what is known as Modern Reports,
in the case of <i>The City of London</i> v. <i>Wood</i>, where
he says:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“I agree, where the city of London claims any freedom or
franchise to itself, there none of London shall be judge or
jury; for there they claim an interest to themselves against
the rest of mankind.”</p>

</div>

<p class="noindent">He then explains the principle:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“It is against all laws, that the same person should be
party and judge in the same cause, for it is manifest contradiction;
for the party is he that is to complain to the
judge, and the judge is to hear the party; the party endeavors
to have his will, the judge determines against the
will of the party, and has authority to enforce him to obey
his sentence: and can any man act against his own will, or
enforce himself to obey? The judge is agent, the party is
patient, and the same person cannot be both agent and
patient in the same thing; but it is the same thing to say
that the same man may be patient and agent in the same
thing as to say that he may be judge and party, and it is
manifest contradiction. And what my Lord Coke says in
<i>Dr. Bonham’s Case</i>, in his 8 Co., is far from any extravagancy;
for it is a very reasonable and true saying, that, if
an Act of Parliament should ordain that the same person
should be party and judge, or, which is the same thing,
judge in his own cause, it would be a void Act of Parliament;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[Pg 19]</a></span>
for it is impossible that one should be judge and
party, for the judge is to determine between party and
party, or between the Government and the party; and an
Act of Parliament can do no wrong, though it may do several
things that look pretty odd, for it may discharge one
from his allegiance to the Government he lives under and
restore him to the state of Nature, but it cannot make one
that lives under a government judge and party.”<a name="FNanchor_11_11" id="FNanchor_11_11"></a><a href="#Footnote_11_11" class="fnanchor">[11]</a></p>

</div>

<p>These are the words of Chief Justice Holt. It will
be observed that three eminent judges, Hobart, Coke,
and Holt, all found the inevitable conclusion on the
immutable principles of Natural Law, that law which is
common to all countries. It is the very law of which
Cicero spoke in the memorable sentence of his treatise
on the Republic, when he said that there was but one
law for all countries, now and in all times, the same
at Athens as in Rome.<a name="FNanchor_12_12" id="FNanchor_12_12"></a><a href="#Footnote_12_12" class="fnanchor">[12]</a> It is also that universal law to
which the great English writer, Hooker, alluded, when
he said that her seat is the bosom of God; all things
on earth do her homage,&mdash;the least as feeling her
care, and the greatest as not exempt from her power.
To this Universal Law all your legislation must be
brought as to a touchstone; and all your conduct in
this Chamber, and all your rules, must be in accordance
with it. Therefore I say, as I began, the practice
of calling the roll of the Senate must be interpreted
in subordination to this commanding rule of
Universal Law.</p>

<p>This is not all. I said that it was forbidden, not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[Pg 20]</a></span>
only by Natural Law, but also by Parliamentary Law.
Of course, Parliamentary Law in itself must be in harmony
with Natural Law; but Parliamentary Law has
undertaken in advance to deal with this very question.
There is no express rule of the Senate on the subject,
but here is a rule of the other House:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“No member shall vote on any question in the event of
which he is immediately and particularly interested.”<a name="FNanchor_13_13" id="FNanchor_13_13"></a><a href="#Footnote_13_13" class="fnanchor">[13]</a></p>

</div>

<p>This is but an expression in parliamentary language
of what I have announced as the rule of universal
jurisprudence. But, Sir, this rule was borrowed from
the rules of the British House of Commons, one of
which is,&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“If anything shall come in question touching the <em>return
or election</em> of any member, he is to withdraw during the
time the matter is in debate.”<a name="FNanchor_14_14" id="FNanchor_14_14"></a><a href="#Footnote_14_14" class="fnanchor">[14]</a></p>

</div>

<p>I quote from May’s Parliamentary Law. From another
work of authority, Dwarris on Statutes, I now
read:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“No member of the House may be present in the House
when a bill or any other business concerning himself is debating;
while the bill is but reading or opening, he may.”<a name="FNanchor_15_15" id="FNanchor_15_15"></a><a href="#Footnote_15_15" class="fnanchor">[15]</a></p>

</div>

<p>Then, after citing two different cases, the learned
writer proceeds:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“This rule was always attended to in questions relative
to the seat of a member on the hearing of controverted
elections, and has been strictly observed in cases of very
great moment.”<a name="FNanchor_16_16" id="FNanchor_16_16"></a><a href="#Footnote_16_16" class="fnanchor">[16]</a></p>

</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[Pg 21]</a></span></p>

<p>Again the same writer says:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“Where a member appeared to be ‘somewhat’ concerned
in interest,”&mdash;</p>

</div>

<p class="noindent">That is the phrase, only “somewhat concerned,”&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“his voice has been disallowed after a division.”<a name="FNanchor_17_17" id="FNanchor_17_17"></a><a href="#Footnote_17_17" class="fnanchor">[17]</a></p>

</div>

<p>Then, again, our own eminent countryman, Cushing,
who was quoted so frequently the other day, in his
elaborate book on the Law and Practice of Legislative
Assemblies, expresses himself as follows:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“Cases are frequent in which votes received have been
disallowed.”<a name="FNanchor_18_18" id="FNanchor_18_18"></a><a href="#Footnote_18_18" class="fnanchor">[18]</a></p>

</div>

<p>Again he says:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“Votes have also been disallowed after the numbers have
been declared, on the ground that the members voting were
interested in the question; and, in reference to this proceeding,
there is no time limited within which it must take
place.”<a name="FNanchor_19_19" id="FNanchor_19_19"></a><a href="#Footnote_19_19" class="fnanchor">[19]</a></p>

</div>

<p>Thus, Sir, it is apparent that Parliamentary Law is
completely in harmony with Natural Law. Indeed, if
it were not, it would be our duty to correct it, that it
might be made in harmony.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>And now, after this statement of the law, which I
believe completely applicable to the present case, I am
brought to consider the remedy. I said at the outset
that there were two modes: one was by disallowing
the vote on motion to that effect, and the other by
amending the journal. But first let me call attention
to the practice in disallowing a vote on motion. I have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[Pg 22]</a></span>
already read from Dwarris, where the vote was disallowed,
and I will read it again:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“Where a member appeared to be ‘somewhat’ concerned
in interest, his voice has been disallowed after a division.”</p>

</div>

<div class="medium">

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Trumbull.</span> Was that at the same or a subsequent
session?</p>

</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Sumner.</span> It does not appear whether it was at
a subsequent session, but it simply appears that it was
after the division. The Senator understands that the
division in the British Parliament corresponds with
what we call the yeas and nays. They “divide,” as it
is called,&mdash;the yeas and the nays being counted by
tellers as they pass.</p>

<p>The American authority is in harmony with the English
already quoted. I read again from Cushing.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“The disallowance of votes usually takes place, when,
after the declaration of the numbers by the Speaker, it is
discovered that certain members who voted were not present
when the question was put, or <em>were so interested in the
question</em>”&mdash;</p>

</div>

<p class="noindent">Mark those words, if you please, Sir&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p class="noindent">“that they ought to have withdrawn from the House.</p>

<p>“It has already been seen, that, when it is ascertained
that members have improperly voted, on a division, who
were not in the House when the question was put, if this
takes place before the numbers are declared by the Speaker,
such votes are disallowed by him at once, and not included
in the numbers declared. If the fact is not ascertained until
after the numbers are declared, it is then necessary that
there should be a motion and vote of the House for their
disallowance; and this may take place, for anything that
appears to the contrary, at any time during the session, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[Pg 23]</a></span>
has in fact taken place after the lapse of several days from
the time the votes were given.”<a name="FNanchor_20_20" id="FNanchor_20_20"></a><a href="#Footnote_20_20" class="fnanchor">[20]</a></p>

</div>

<p>Thus much for the remedy by disallowance; and this
brings me to the proposition by amending the journal.
That remedy, from the nature of the case, is applicable
to an error apparent on the face of the journal. I ask
Senators to note the distinction. It is applicable to an
error apparent on the face of the journal. If the interest
of a Senator appeared only by evidence <i>aliunde</i>, by evidence
outside, as, for instance, that he had some private
interest in the results of a pending measure by which he
was disqualified, his vote could be disallowed only on
motion; but if the incapacity of the Senator to vote
on a particular occasion appears on the journal itself,
I submit that the journal must be amended by striking
out his vote. The case is patent. We have already
seen, by the opinions of eminent judges, great masters
of law in different ages, that what is contrary to the
principles of Natural Law must be void; and English
judges tell us that even an Act of Parliament must be
treated as void, if it undertakes to make a man judge
in his own case.</p>

<p>Now, Sir, apply that principle to your journal. It
has recognized a man as judge in his own case. I
insist that the recognition was void. Is not the true
remedy by amending the journal so as to strike out his
name? The journal discloses the two essential facts,&mdash;first,
that as Senator he was party to the proceedings,
secondly, that as Senator he was judge in the proceedings;
and since these two facts appear on the face of
the journal, it seems to me that the only substantial
remedy is by amending it, so that a precedent of such<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</a></span>
a character shall not find place hereafter in the records
of the Senate.</p>

<p>Sir, this question is not insignificant; it is grave.
It belongs to the privileges of the Senate. I might
almost say, it is closely associated with the character
of the Senate. Can Senators sit here and allow one
of their number, on an important occasion, to come
forward and play at the same time the two great parts,
party and judge? And yet these two great parts have
been played, and your journal records the performance.
Suppose Jesse D. Bright, some years since expelled
from the Senate, after animated debate lasting weeks,
and our excellent Judiciary Committee reporting in his
favor,&mdash;suppose he had undertaken to vote for himself,&mdash;is
there a Senator who would not have felt it
wrong to admit his vote? The defendant showed no
want of hardihood, but he did not offer to vote for himself.
But, if Mr. Stockton can vote for himself, how
can you prevent a Senator from voting to save himself
from expulsion? The rule must be the same in the
two cases. Therefore I ask that the journal be rectified,
in harmony with Parliamentary Law and the principles
of Universal Law.</p>

<p>In making this motion, I have no other motive than
to protect the rights of the Senate, and to establish
those principles of justice which will be a benefit to
our country for all time. You cannot lightly see a
great principle sacrificed. You abandon your duty, if
you allow an elementary principle of justice to be set
at nought in this Chamber. Be it, Sir, our pride to
uphold those truths and to stand by those principles.
I know no way in which we can do it now so completely
as in the motion I have made. The vote of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[Pg 25]</a></span>
Mr. Stockton was null and void. It should be treated
as if it had not been given.</p>

<p>I have no doubt that the motion to correct the journal
would be in order even at a late day. I believe
that at any day any Senator might rise in his place
and move to expunge from the journal a record in itself
derogatory to the body. I have in my hands a reference
to the case of John Wilkes, who, you will remember,
just before our Revolution, was excluded from Parliament,
while his competitor, Luttrell, was declared
duly elected. The decision of Parliament, so the history
records, convulsed the whole kingdom for thirteen
years, but after that long period it was expunged from
the journal,&mdash;I now quote the emphatic words,&mdash;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[Pg 26]</a></span>“as
being subversive of the rights of the whole body of
electors of this kingdom.” I submit, Sir, the record
in your journal is subversive of the great principle of
jurisprudence on which the rights of every citizen depend.</p>

<div class="medium">

<p>Mr. Reverdy Johnson followed, criticizing Mr. Sumner. He concluded
by saying: “Even supposing there was the slightest want of
delicacy in casting a vote upon such a question by the member whose
seat is contested, it was in the particular instance more than justified
by the circumstances existing at the time the vote was cast.”</p>

<p>Mr. Trumbull said:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“I believe, as I said before, that the Senator from New Jersey is entitled
to his seat; but I do not believe that he is entitled to hold his seat by his
own vote. He would have held his seat without his own vote. The vote
upon the resolution was a tie without the vote of the Senator from New Jersey;
and that would have left him in his seat, he already having been sworn
in as a member. It is not necessary that the resolution should have passed.
He is here as a Senator, and it would require an affirmative vote to deprive
him of his seat as a Senator.”</p>

</div>

<p>He then avowed his willingness to move a reconsideration of the
vote by which the resolution was carried, “if that is necessary to
accomplish the object.”</p>

<p>Mr. Sumner, after saying, that, when he brought forward his motion,
he had no reason to suppose that any Senator would move a reconsideration,
proceeded:&mdash;</p>

</div>

<p>The Senator from Illinois says, Suppose we strike
out Mr. Stockton’s name, what will be the effect? I
answer, To change all subsequent proceedings, and make
them as if he had not voted, so that the whole record
must be corrected accordingly. The Senator supposes
a bill passed by mistake afterwards discovered, and asks
if the bill could be arrested. Clearly, if not too late.
A familiar anecdote with regard to the passage of the
Act of <i>Habeas Corpus</i> in England will help answer
the Senator. According to the story,&mdash;it is Bishop
Burnet who tells it,<a name="FNanchor_21_21" id="FNanchor_21_21"></a><a href="#Footnote_21_21" class="fnanchor">[21]</a>&mdash;this great act, which gave to
the English people what has since been called the
palladium of their liberties, passed under a misapprehension
created by a jest. It seems that among the
affirmative peers walking through the tellers was one
especially fat, when it was said, “Count ten,”&mdash;and
ten was counted for the bill, thus securing its passage.
I am not aware that the mistake was divulged until
too late for correction. But we have had in the other
House two different cases, which answer precisely the
inquiry of the Senator.</p>

<div class="medium">

<p>Here Mr. Sumner read from the House Journal, 29th Congress, 1st
Session, July 6, 1846, p. 1032, a motion by Mr. McGaughey with regard
to the Journal. He next read from the House Journal, 31st
Congress, 1st Session, September 10, 1850, p. 1436, the following entry:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“The Speaker stated that the result of the vote of the House on yesterday
on the passage of the bill of the House (No. 387) to supply a deficiency
in the appropriation for pay and mileage of members of Congress for the
present session had been erroneously announced, and that the subsequent
proceedings upon the said bill would consequently fall.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[Pg 27]</a></span></p>

<p>“The Speaker then announced the vote to be, Yeas 78, Nays 76.</p>

<p>“So the bill was passed; and the journal of yesterday was ordered to be
amended accordingly.”</p>

</div>

<p>In conformity with this precedent, Mr. Sumner did not doubt that
by the correction of the journal the vote affirming Mr. Stockton’s seat
would fall, and he thought it better to follow this course; but, anxious
to avoid a protracted discussion, and to “seek a practical result,” he
was willing to withdraw his proposition.</p>

<p>Mr. Sherman, of Ohio, thought that Mr. Sumner would “err in withdrawing
the proposition.” Mr. Davis, of Kentucky, maintained “that
Mr. Stockton had an undoubted right to vote.” Mr. Stockton followed
in vindication of his vote, referring especially to an alleged
understanding between Mr. Morrill and Mr. Wright, which he said
was violated by the vote of the former.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“I never looked upon this as my case. It was the case of the Senator
from New Jersey. And when one gentleman from New Jersey, my colleague,
was deprived of his vote by&mdash;what shall I term it? I do not propose
to violate parliamentary propriety by terming it anything,&mdash;but when
one Senator from New Jersey by artifice was prevented from recording his
vote, as he would have done, the other was not to vote from delicacy.</p>

<p>“Mr. President, there are eleven States out of the Union, and they
wanted to put New Jersey out; and I did not mean that they should do it
from motives of delicacy on my part.”</p>

</div>

<p>Mr. Trumbull said, “Let us settle at this time that a member has
no right to vote upon the question.… I think, upon consideration,
that perhaps the best way to arrive at it is by the adoption
of the resolution offered by the Senator from Massachusetts.” Mr.
Lane, of Kansas, who had voted to sustain Mr. Stockton, said, “I was
never more surprised in my life than when the Senator from New
Jersey asked to vote and did vote.” Soon afterwards, Mr. Stockton
said, “I rise to withdraw my vote, with the permission of the Senate,”
and proceeded to explain his position. In reply to an inquiry from
Mr. Sumner, the presiding officer [Mr. <span class="smcap">Clark</span>, of New Hampshire]
said, “The Chair is of opinion that he cannot, unless by the unanimous
consent of the Senate he wishes to correct the journal.” Mr.
Sumner formally withdrew his motion to correct the journal, “with
the understanding that the Senator from Vermont [Mr. <span class="smcap">Poland</span>]
makes the motion for a reconsideration.” Mr. Poland accordingly
moved the reconsideration, and this was agreed to, so that the original
question was again before the Senate. There was still debate and
perplexity as to the proper proceeding in order to repair the error in
receiving Mr. Stockton’s vote, when Mr. Sumner moved:&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[Pg 28]</a></span></p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“That the vote of Mr. Stockton be not received, in determining the question
of his seat in the Senate.”</p>

</div>

<p>Mr. Sumner remarked:&mdash;</p>

</div>

<p>I have no personal question with the Senator; I
have for him nothing but kindness and respect. I
deal with this question simply as a question of principle.
The Senator tells us that he will not vote, when
the case comes up again. I believe him; he will not
vote. But, Sir, he has taken the Constitution in his
hand, and, holding it up, he tells us that he finds in
that instrument authority for it in his case.…</p>

<p>Since the Senator makes the claim, it is important
for us to meet it, in some way or other,&mdash;by correcting
the journal, or by a resolution declaring that the
Senator shall not vote,&mdash;fixing the precedent forever,
so that hereafter we shall not be left to the uncertain
will or opinion of a Senator whose seat may be in
question. We must rely, not upon his honor, but upon
the Constitution, interpreted by this body and fixed
beyond recall. Therefore I think still it would be
better, if the Senate had corrected its journal. Being
a vote that in itself was null and void, it was to be
treated as not having been given.</p>

<p>The Senator asks to withdraw his vote. To withdraw
what? Something which has never been done,&mdash;that
is, legally done. There is no legal vote of the
Senator. His name is recorded as having voted, but
it is a vote that at the time was null and void. There
is nothing, therefore, for him to withdraw, but something
for the Senate to annul.</p>

<div class="medium">

<p>Mr. Sherman moved the reference of Mr. Sumner’s resolution to the
Committee on the Judiciary. The Senate refused to refer,&mdash;Yeas 18,
Nays 22. The resolution was then adopted.</p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[Pg 29]</a></span>
<p>March 27th, the consideration of the resolution declaring Mr. Stockton
“duly elected” was resumed, when, after the failure of an effort
to postpone it, Mr. Clark moved to amend it by declaring that he “is
not entitled to a seat as Senator.” On this amendment Mr. Stockton
spoke at length. The amendment was adopted,&mdash;Yeas 22, Nays 21,&mdash;Mr.
Stockton not voting. He said, “I desire to state, in order that
it may be a part of the record, that I do not vote on this question, on
account of the resolution passed by the Senate yesterday.” The resolution
as amended was then adopted,&mdash;Yeas 23, Nays 20.</p>

<p>This bill, reported from the Judiciary Committee by Mr. Harris, of
New York, was considered for several days in the Senate, and finally
passed that body. It failed in the House of Representatives. Another
bill, having a similar object, afterwards became a law.<a name="FNanchor_22_22" id="FNanchor_22_22"></a><a href="#Footnote_22_22" class="fnanchor">[22]</a></p>

<p>On the present bill Mr. Sumner remarked:&mdash;</p>

</div>

<p class="dropcap">We all know that the Supreme Court is now some
three years behind in its business, and the practical
question is, How are we to bring relief? There
are two different ways. One is by limiting appeals, so
that hereafter it shall have less business. Another, and
to my mind the better way, would be to allow appeals
substantially as now, but to limit the court to the exclusive
hearing of those appeals. Of course that raises
the question, whether the judges of the Supreme Court
sitting here in Washington should have duties elsewhere.
That is a question of practice, and also of
theory. Since I have been in the Senate, it has been
very often discussed, formally or informally, and there
have been differences of opinion upon it. I believe the
inclination has always been that judges are better in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[Pg 31]</a></span>
the discharge of their duties from experience at <i>Nisi
Prius</i>. That opinion, I take it, is derived from England;
and yet I need not remind the Senator from
New York that the two highest courts in England
are held by judges who at the time do nothing at
<i>Nisi Prius</i>, and do not go the circuit: I refer to the
court of the Privy Council, and to the highest court
of all, the court of the House of Lords. If you pass
over to France, where certainly the judicature is admirably
arranged on principles of science, where I
believe justice is assured, you have the highest court,
known as the Court of Cassation, composed of persons
set apart exclusively for appeals,&mdash;never leaving
Paris, and never hearing any other business except
that which comes before them on appeal.</p>

<p>I refer to these instances for illustration. The Senate
is also aware, that, in the beginning of our Government,
when Washington invited his first Chief Justice
and his Associates to communicate their views on the
subject of the Judiciary system, the answer, prepared
by John Jay, assigned strong reasons why the Supreme
Court should be exclusively for the consideration of
appeals.<a name="FNanchor_23_23" id="FNanchor_23_23"></a><a href="#Footnote_23_23" class="fnanchor">[23]</a> The other business was by circuit judges.
This recommendation was put aside, and the existing
system prevailed. Justice has been administered to
the satisfaction of the country, reasonably at least, under
this system.</p>

<p>But now we are driven to a pass: justice threatens
to fail in the Supreme Court, unless we provide relief.
Is the bill of the Senator from New York adequate?
Speaking frankly, I fear that it is not; and I fear<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[Pg 32]</a></span>
that the proposition of my friend from Wisconsin [Mr.
<span class="smcap">Howe</span>], if adopted, will still further limit the relief
which my friend from New York proposes. I am disposed
to believe that the only real relief will be found
in setting apart the judges of our highest court exclusively
for the consideration of appeals. They would
then sit as many months in the year as they could
reasonably give to judicial labor. They might, perhaps,
hear every case that could reach the tribunal,
while they had a vacation to themselves in which to
review the science of their profession and add undoubtedly
to their attainments. I remember that one
of the ablest lawyers in England, in testimony some
years ago before a Committee of the House of Commons
on the value of what is known as the vacation,&mdash;I
refer to Sir James Scarlett, afterward Lord Abinger,
Lord Chief Baron,&mdash;testified that for one, as an
old lawyer, he regarded the vacation as important, because
it gave him an opportunity to review his studies
and to read books that he could not read in the urgency
of practice. I have heard our own judges make similar
remarks.</p>

<p>Now the question is, whether the present bill meets
the case. Does it supply the needed relief? I fear
it does not; and I really should be much better satisfied,
if my friend from New York had dealt more boldly
with the whole question by providing a court of appeal,
composed of the eminent judges of the land, devoted
exclusively to appeals, and leaving to other judges the
hearing of cases at <i>Nisi Prius</i>.</p>

VERMONT.</h2>

<p class="plabeln"><span class="smcap">Speech in the Senate, on his Death, April 12, 1866.</span></p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/line.png" width="80" height="16" alt="" />
</div>

<p class="dropcap">MR. PRESIDENT,&mdash;There is a truce in this Chamber.
The antagonism of debate is hushed. The
sounds of conflict have died away. The white flag is
flying. From opposite camps we meet to bury the dead.
It is a Senator we bury, not a soldier.</p>

<p>This is the second time during the present session
that we have been called to mourn a distinguished
Senator from Vermont. It was much to bear the loss
once. Its renewal now, after so brief a period, is a
calamity without precedent in the history of the Senate.
No State before has ever lost two Senators so
near together.</p>

<p>Mr. Foot, at his death, was the oldest Senator in continuous
service. He entered the Senate in the same
Congress with the Senator from Ohio [Mr. <span class="smcap">Wade</span>] and
myself; but he was sworn at the executive session
in March, while the two others were not sworn till
the opening of Congress at the succeeding December.
During this considerable space of time I have been the
constant witness to his life and conversation. With a
sentiment of gratitude I look back upon our relations,
never from the beginning impaired or darkened by difference.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[Pg 34]</a></span>
For one brief moment he seemed disturbed
by something that fell from me in the unconscious intensity
of my convictions; but it was for a brief moment
only, and he took my hand with a genial grasp.
I make haste also to declare my sense of his personal
purity and his incorruptible nature. Such elements of
character, exhibited and proved throughout a long service,
render him an example for all. He is gone; but
these virtues “smell sweet and blossom in the dust.”</p>

<p>He was excellent in judgment. He was excellent
also in speech; so that, whenever he spoke, the wonder
was that he who spoke so well should speak so seldom.
He was full, clear, direct, emphatic, and never was diverted
from the thread of his argument. Had he been
moved to mingle actively in debate, he must have exerted
a commanding influence over opinion in the Senate
and in the country. How often we have watched
him tranquil in his seat, while others without his experience
or weight occupied attention! The reticence
which was part of his nature formed a contrast to
that prevailing effusion where sometimes the facility
of speech is less remarkable than the inability to keep
silence; and, again, it formed a contrast to that controversial
spirit which too often, like an unwelcome wind,
puts out the lights while it fans a flame. And yet in
his treatment of questions he was never incomplete or
perfunctory. If he did not say, with the orator and
parliamentarian of France, the famous founder of the
“Doctrinaire” school of politics, M. Royer-Collard, that
respect for his audience would not permit him to ask
attention until he had reduced his thoughts to writing,
it was evident that he never spoke in the Senate without
careful preparation. You remember well his commemoration<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[Pg 35]</a></span>
of his late colleague, only a few short
weeks ago, when he delivered a funeral oration not
unworthy of the French school from which this form
of eloquence is derived. Alas! as we listened to that
most elaborate eulogy, shaped by study and penetrated
by feeling, how little did we think that it was so soon
to be echoed back from his own tomb!</p>

<p>Not in our debates only did this self-abnegation show
itself. He quietly withdrew from places of importance
on committees to which he was entitled, and which he
would have filled with honor. More than once I have
known him insist that another should take the position
assigned to himself. He was far from that nature
which Lord Bacon exposes in pungent humor, when he
speaks of “extreme self-lovers,” that “will set an house
on fire and it were but to roast their eggs.”<a name="FNanchor_24_24" id="FNanchor_24_24"></a><a href="#Footnote_24_24" class="fnanchor">[24]</a> And yet it
must not be disguised that he was happy in the office
of Senator. It was to him as much as his “dukedom”
to Prospero. He felt its honors and confessed its duties.
But he was content. He desired nothing more. Perhaps
no person appreciated so thoroughly what it was
to bear the commission of a State in this Chamber.
Surely no person appreciated so thoroughly all the dignities
belonging to the Senate. Of its ceremonial he
was the admitted arbiter.</p>

<p>There was no jealousy, envy, or uncharitableness in
him. He enjoyed what others did, and praised generously.
He knew that his own just position could
not be disturbed by the success of another. Whatever
another may be, whether more or less, a man must
always be himself. A true man is a positive, and not
a relative quantity. Properly inspired, he will know<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[Pg 36]</a></span>
that in a just sense nobody can stand in the way of
another. And here let me add, that, in proportion as
this truth enters into practical life, we shall all become
associates and coadjutors rather than rivals. How plain,
that, in the infinite diversity of character and talent,
there is place for every one! This world is wide enough
for all its inhabitants; this republic is grand enough
for all its people. Let every one serve in his place according
to his allotted faculties.</p>

<p>In the long warfare with Slavery, Mr. Foot was from
the beginning firmly and constantly on the side of Freedom.
He was against the deadly compromises of 1850.
He linked his shield in the small, but solid, phalanx of
the Senate which opposed the Nebraska Bill. He was
faithful in the defence of Kansas, menaced by Slavery;
and when at last this barbarous rebel took up arms, he
accepted the issue, and did all he could for his country.
But even the cause which for years he had so much at
heart did not lead him into debate, except rarely. His
opinions appeared in votes, rather than in speeches.
But his sympathies were easily known. I call to mind,
that, on first coming into the Senate, and not yet personally
familiar with him, I was assured by Mr. Giddings,
who knew him well, that he belonged to the
small circle who would stand by Freedom, and the
Antislavery patriarch related pleasantly, how Mr. Foot,
on his earliest visit to the House of Representatives
after he became Senator, drew attention by coming
directly to his seat and sitting by his side in friendly
conversation. Solomon Foot by the side of Joshua R.
Giddings, in those days, when Slavery still tyrannized,
is a picture not to be forgotten. If our departed friend
is not to be named among those who have borne the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[Pg 37]</a></span>
burden of this great controversy, he cannot be forgotten
among those whose sympathies with Liberty
never failed. Would that he had done more! Let
us be thankful that he did so much.</p>

<p>There is a part on the stage known as “the walking
gentleman,” who has very little to say, but always appears
well. Mr. Foot might seem, at times, to have
adopted this part, if we were not constantly reminded
of his watchfulness in everything concerning the course
of business and the administration of Parliamentary
Law. Here he excelled, and was master of us all.
The division of labor, which is the lesson of political
economy, is also the lesson of public life. All cannot
do all things. Some do one, others do another,&mdash;each
according to his gifts. This diversity produces
harmony.</p>

<p>The office of President <i>pro tempore</i> among us grows
out of the anomalous relations of the Vice-President to
the Senate. There is no such officer in the other House,
nor was there in the House of Commons until very recently,
when we read of a “Deputy Speaker,” which is
the term by which he is addressed, when in the chair.
No ordinary talent can guide and control a legislative
assembly, especially if numerous or excited by party
differences. A good presiding officer is like Alexander
mounted on Bucephalus. The assembly knows its master,
“as the horse its rider.” This was preëminently
the case with Mr. Foot, who was often in the chair,
and for a considerable period our President <i>pro tempore</i>.
Here he showed special adaptation and power.
He was in person “every inch” a President; so also was
he in every sound of the voice. He carried into the
chair the most marked individuality that has been seen<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[Pg 38]</a></span>
there during this generation. He was unlike any other
presiding officer. “None but himself could be his parallel.”
His presence was felt instantly. It filled this
Chamber from floor to gallery. It attached itself to
everything done. Vigor and despatch prevailed. Questions
were stated so as to challenge attention. Impartial
justice was manifest at once. Business in every
form was handled with equal ease. Order was enforced
with no timorous authority. If disturbance came from
the gallery, how promptly he launched the fulmination!
If it came from the floor, you have often seen
him throw himself back, and then with voice of lordship,
as if all the Senate were in him, insist that
debate should be suspended until order was restored.
“The Senate must come to order!” he exclaimed; and,
like the god Thor, beat with hammer in unison with
voice, until the reverberations rattled like thunder in
the mountains.</p>

<p>The late Duc de Morny, who was the accomplished
President of the Legislative Assembly of France, in
a sitting shortly before his death, after sounding his
crier’s bell, which is the substitute for the hammer
among us, exclaimed from the chair: “I shall be obliged
to mention by name the members whom I find conversing.
I declare to you that I shall do so, and I
shall have it put in the ‘Moniteur.’ You are here to
discuss and to listen, not to converse. I promise you
that I will do what I say to the very first I catch
talking.” Our President might have found occasion for
a similar speech, but his energy in the enforcement of
order stopped short of this menace. Certainly he did
everything consistent with the temper of the Senate,
and he showed always what Sir William Scott, on one<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[Pg 39]</a></span>
occasion, in the House of Commons, placed among the
essential qualities of a Speaker, when he said that “to
a jealous affection for the privileges of the House” must
be added “an awful sense of its duties.”<a name="FNanchor_25_25" id="FNanchor_25_25"></a><a href="#Footnote_25_25" class="fnanchor">[25]</a></p>

<p>Accustomed as we have become to the rules which
govern legislative proceedings, we are hardly aware of
their importance in the development of liberal institutions.
Unknown in antiquity, they were unknown
also on the European continent until latterly introduced
from England, which was their original home.
They are among the precious contributions which England
has made to modern civilization; and yet they
did not assume at once their present perfect form. Mr.
Hallam tells us that even as late as Queen Elizabeth
“the members called confusedly for the business they
wished to have brought forward.”<a name="FNanchor_26_26" id="FNanchor_26_26"></a><a href="#Footnote_26_26" class="fnanchor">[26]</a> But now, at last,
these rules have become a beautiful machine, by which
business is conducted, legislation moulded, and debate
in all possible freedom secured. From the presentation
of a petition or the introduction of a bill, all proceeds
by fixed processes, until, without disorder, the final result
is reached and a new law takes its place in the
statute-book. Hoe’s printing-press or Alden’s type-setter
is not more exact in operation. But the rules
are more even than a beautiful machine; they are the
very temple of Constitutional Liberty. In this temple
our departed friend served to the end with pious care.
His associates, as they recall his stately form, silvered
by time, but beaming with goodness, will not cease to
cherish the memory of such service. His image will<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[Pg 40]</a></span>
rise before them as the faithful presiding officer, by
whom the dignity of the Senate was maintained, its
business advanced, and Parliamentary Law upheld.</p>

<p>He had always looked with delight upon this Capitol,&mdash;one
of the most remarkable edifices of the world,&mdash;beautiful
in itself, but more beautiful still as the
emblem of that national unity he loved so well. He
enjoyed its enlargement and improvement. He watched
with pride its marble columns moving into place, and
its dome as it ascended to the skies. Even the trials
of the war did not make him forget it. His care secured
those appropriations by which the work was forwarded
to its close, and the statue of Liberty installed
on its sublime pedestal. It was natural that in his
last moments, as life was failing fast, he should long
to rest his eyes upon an object that was to him so
dear. The early light of morning had come, and he
was lifted in bed that with mortal sight he might once
more behold this Capitol; but another Capitol already
began to fill his vision, fairer than your marble columns,
sublimer than your dome, where Liberty without
any statue is glorified in that service which is
perfect Freedom.</p>

<p class="dropcap">DEAR SIR,&mdash;It will not be in my power to celebrate
with you Emancipation in the District, but
I rejoice that the beautiful anniversary is to be commemorated.</p>

<p>Looking back upon the day when that Act became a
law by the signature of Abraham Lincoln, I feel how
grandly it has been vindicated by the result. The sinister
forebodings of your enemies are all falsified. We
were told that you could not bear freedom,&mdash;that you
would be lawless, idle, and thriftless. I knew the contrary;
and is it not as I foretold? Who so mad as to
wish back the old system of wrong?</p>

<p>But the work is only <em>half done</em>. The freedman, despoiled
of the elective franchise, is only <em>half a man</em>.
He must be made <em>a whole man</em>; and this can be only
by investing him with all the rights of an American
citizen. Here, too, we encounter the same sinister forebodings
that stood in the way of Emancipation. We
are told that you cannot bear enfranchisement, and that
you will not know how to vote. I know the contrary;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[Pg 42]</a></span>
and I am satisfied, further, that there can be no true
repose in this country until all its people are admitted
to that full equality before the law which is the essential
principle of republican government. It were not
enough to assure equality in what are called civil
rights. This is only <em>semi-equality</em>. The equality must
be complete. This I ask, not only for your sake, but
also for the sake of my country, imperilled by such a
denial of justice.</p>

<p class="plabeln"><span class="smcap">Speech in the Senate, on a Bill for the Relief of certain
Contractors, April 17, 1866.</span></p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/line.png" width="80" height="16" alt="" />
</div>

<div class="medium">

<p>The Senate having under consideration a bill for the relief of certain
contractors for the construction of vessels of war and steam machinery,
Mr. Sumner said:&mdash;</p>

</div>

<p class="dropcap">MR. PRESIDENT,&mdash;I am happy to agree with
the Senator from Kentucky [Mr. <span class="smcap">Guthrie</span>] in
the fundamental principle he has laid down and developed
so clearly. I agree with him, that by no legislation
of ours can we recognize the principle that contractors
with the Government may never lose. The Senator
cannot state the proposition too strongly. But I
part company with him, when he undertakes to apply
it to the present case. We agree on the proposition;
we disagree on the application.</p>

<p>Had these contracts covered a period of peace, there
would have been occasion for the rule of the Senator.
But they were not in a period of peace; they were
in a period of war. And the Senator himself has characterized
the war as perhaps the greatest in history.
If not made in a time of war, they were all the harder
performed in those early days which were heralds of
war. The practical question for us as legislators is,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[Pg 44]</a></span>
whether we can shut our eyes to that condition of
things. The times were exceptional; and so must the
remedy be also.</p>

<p>I have said, had it been a season of peace, then
the Senator would be right, and we should not be
justified in seeking exceptionally to open the Treasury
for the relief of these contractors. But, Sir, war
is a mighty disturber. What force in human society,
what force in business, more disturbing? Wherever
it goes, it not only carries death and destruction,
but derangement of business, change of pursuits,
interference with the currency, and generally dislocation
of the common relations of life. You cannot be
blind to such a condition of things. You must not
shut your eyes to its consequences, if you would do
justice now.</p>

<p>I repeat, therefore, did these contracts grow out of
a period of peace, I should not now advocate them;
but it is because they grow out of a period of war, that
I ask for those who have suffered by them the same
justice we accord to all who have contributed to our
success in that terrible war. Why, Sir, how often do
we appeal in this Chamber for justice to all who have
helped the great result! It is my duty constantly to
plead here for justice to those freedmen who have done
so much and placed you under ceaseless obligations. I
hope I am not indifferent also to those national creditors
who supplied the means which advanced our triumph,&mdash;nor
yet again to those soldiers, whether on
land or sea, who have so powerfully served the national
cause. But there is still another class, for whom
no one has yet spoken on this floor, who have contributed
to our success not less than soldier or creditor,&mdash;I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[Pg 45]</a></span>
was almost ready to say, not less than the freedman:
I mean the mechanics of the country. They, Sir,
have helped you carry this war to its victorious close.
Without the mechanics, where would you have been?
what would have been your equipments on the land?
where would have been that marvellous navy on the
sea? It was the skilled labor of the country, rushing
so promptly to the rescue, that gave you the power
which carried you on from victory to victory.</p>

<p>Now, Sir, the practical question is, whether these
mechanics, who have done so much to turn the tide
of battle, shall be losers by the skill, the labor, and
the time they devoted to your triumph. Tell me not,
Sir, that they acted according to contract. To that I
reply, The war disturbed the contract, and it is your
duty here, sitting as a high court of equity, to review
all the circumstances of the case, and see in what way
the remedy may be fitly applied. You cannot turn
away from the equities, treating it literally and severely
according to the precise terms of the contract.
You must go into those vital considerations arising out
of the peculiar circumstances.</p>

<p>Several facts are obvious to all: a Senator on the
other side of the Chamber has alluded to them. In
the first place, there was the general increase in the
price of labor and material that ensued after these contracts
were made. Nobody doubts this. There was
then a change in the currency. There were, also,&mdash;what
have been alluded to several times,&mdash;changes in
the models of these vessels at the Navy Department,
necessarily imposing upon these contractors additional
expense and labor. There was another circumstance,
to which my attention has been directed latterly,&mdash;I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[Pg 46]</a></span>
believe, however, the Senator from Iowa [Mr. <span class="smcap">Grimes</span>]
alluded to it yesterday,&mdash;that at the moment of the
war, when labor was highest, when it was most difficult
to obtain it, there came an order from the proper
authorities exempting those who labored in the arsenals
and public yards of the United States from enrolment.
Of course, all then in private yards or with contractors,
so far as they could, hurried under the national
flag, that they might become workmen there, and thus
obtain the coveted exemption from enrolment.</p>

<p class="center">…</p>

<p>This order illustrates very plainly the disturbing
influence from the war; and this brings me again to
press this point upon your attention. I mention certain
particulars in which this appeared; but I would
bring home the controlling consideration that we were
in a time of war, vast in proportions and most disturbing
in its influence. This alone is enough to account
for the failure of these contractors. We were
not in a period of peace, and you err, if you undertake
to hold these contractors to all the austere responsibilities
proper in a period of peace.</p>

<p>The Senator from Kentucky said that they took the
war into their calculations. Perhaps they did; but
who among these contractors could take that war adequately
into his calculations? Who among those sitting
here or at the other end of the avenue properly
appreciated the character of the great contest coming
on? Sir, we had passed half a century in peace; we
knew nothing of war, or of war preparations, when all
at once we were called to efforts on a gigantic scale.
Are you astonished that these contractors did not know
more about the war than your statesmen? Be to these<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[Pg 47]</a></span>
contractors as gentle in judgment and as considerate as
you are to others in public life who have erred in calculations
with regard to it.</p>

<p>I have said that the interest now in question was
the great mechanical interest of the country. It is an
interest that is not local, as the bill is for the benefit
of mechanics in all parts of the loyal States, from Maryland,
in the South, to Massachusetts and Maine, in the
North and East, and then stretching from New York,
on the seaboard, to Missouri, beyond the Mississippi.
I have a list of the States concerned, through different
contractors, in this very bill,&mdash;Maine, Massachusetts,
Rhode Island, Connecticut, New York, New Jersey,
Pennsylvania, Delaware, Maryland, Ohio, Illinois, Missouri,
and even California. The interest for which I
am speaking crosses the mountains and reaches to the
Pacific Ocean.</p>

<p>I said that this was the skilled labor of the country.
What labor more valuable? what service, while
the war was proceeding, more important? If these
mechanics did not expose their persons in the peril of
battle, they gave their skill to prepare others for victory.
In ancient times, the oracle said to the city in
danger, “Look to your wooden walls.” The oracle in
our country said, “Look to your ironclads and your
double-enders”; and these mechanics came forward and
by ingenious labor enabled you to put ironclads and
double-enders on the ocean, and thus secure the final
triumph. The building of that invulnerable navy was
one of the great triumphs of the war, to be commemorated
on many a special field, and to be seen in the
mighty results we now enjoy.</p>

<p>And yet again I ask, Are you ready to see contractors,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[Pg 48]</a></span>
who have done this service, sacrificed? You do
not allow the soldier to be sacrificed, nor the national
creditor who has taken your stock. Will you allow
the mechanic? There are many who, without your
help, must suffer. One of the most enterprising and
faithful in the whole country is a constituent of my
own, who, during the last year, has been hurried into
bankruptcy from inability to meet liabilities growing
out of the war, and at this moment he finds no chance
of relief except in what a just Government may return
to him. My friend on my right [Mr. <span class="smcap">Nye</span>, of Nevada]
asked you to be magnanimous to these contractors. I
do not put it in that way. I ask you simply to be
upright. Do by them as you would be done by.</p>

<p>The Senator from Nevada also very fitly reminded
you of the experience of other countries. He told you
that England, at the close of the Crimean War, when
her mechanics had suffered precisely as yours, did not
allow them to be sacrificed, but every pound, every shilling,
of liability under their contracts was promptly met
by that Government. Will you be less just to mechanics
than England? It is an old saying, that republics
are ungrateful. I hope that this republic will vie with
any monarchy in gratitude to those who have served it.
You have shown energy in meeting your enemies. I
ask you to show a commensurate energy in doing justice
to those who have contributed to your success.</p>

<p class="plabeln"><span class="smcap">Remarks in the Senate, on a Resolution to print a Letter

April 25, 1866.</span></p>

<div class="figcenter">

</div>

<div class="medium">

<p>Mr. Sherman of Ohio, reported the following resolution from the
Committee on Agriculture:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“<i>Resolved</i>, That there be printed, for the use of the Senate, ten thousand
copies of a letter of the Commissioner of Agriculture, communicating information
in relation to the rinderpest or cattle-plague.”</p>

</div>

<p>In considering the resolution, he remarked that the Committee
“would like very much to report some measure of a practical character,
to counteract, if possible, the cattle-plague now prevailing in
Europe; but we did not see that Congress had authority to pass an
effective measure.” Mr. Sumner followed:&mdash;</p>

</div>

<p class="dropcap">I was sorry to hear two remarks of the Senator
from Ohio. The first told that the cattle-plague
is coming. I hope that by proper precautions it may
be averted. I do trust it may never come. I will
not despair that the Atlantic Ocean may be a barrier.
I was sorry also for the other remark, that in his opinion
Congress could not apply any efficient remedy. I
make no issue on this conclusion; but I was sorry that
the Senator having the question in charge had arrived
at that result. It does seem to me, that, under the
National Government, Congress should be able to apply<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[Pg 50]</a></span>
a remedy in such a case. Is not the National Government
defective to a certain extent, if Congress has not
that power? I open the question interrogatively now,
without undertaking to express an opinion upon it.</p>

<p>I agree with the Senator, that it is of great importance
that our people should be put on their guard;
he, therefore, is right in proposing to circulate all information
on the subject. But I do hope that the
Senator will consider carefully whether it be not within
the power of Congress, in some way or other, directly
or indirectly, to apply an efficient remedy.</p>

Society. My duty keeps me here.</p>

<p>I trust that the Society, which has done so much
for human rights, will persevere until these rights are
established throughout the country on the impregnable

great question, and that it may do anything needful to
assure these rights. In this conviction I shall not hesitate

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/line.png" width="80" height="16" alt="" />
</div>

<div class="medium">

<p>Mr. Dixon, of Connecticut, gave notice of his intention to offer, as
a substitute for the bills and resolution reported by the Joint Committee
on Reconstruction, the following:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“That the interests of peace and the interests of the Union require the
admission of every State to its share in public legislation, whenever it presents
itself, not only in an attitude of loyalty and harmony, but in the persons
of representatives whose loyalty cannot be questioned under any constitutional
or legal test.”</p>

</div>

<p>In the debate on printing this resolution, Mr. Sumner said:&mdash;</p>

</div>

<p class="dropcap">I was about to say that the proposition involved
in the resolution of the Senator from Connecticut
is so important that it may be considered as always in
order to discuss it. I do not know that we ought to
pass a day without in some way considering it. I certainly
do not deprecate this debate; but while so saying,
I am very positive on another point. I should
deprecate any effort now to precipitate decision on the
question; and I most sincerely hope that the Senator
from Maine [Mr. <span class="smcap">Fessenden</span>], the Chairman of the
Committee on Reconstruction, who has this matter in
charge, will bear that in mind. I do not believe that
Congress at this moment is in a condition to give the
country the best measure on this important subject.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[Pg 53]</a></span>
I am afraid that excellent Committee has listened too
much to voices from without, insisting that there must
be a political issue presented to the country. I have
always thought such call premature. There is no occasion
now for an issue. There are no elections in any
States. The election in Connecticut is over; the election
in New Hampshire is over. There are to be no
elections before next autumn. What occasion, then,
for an issue? I see none, unless Congress, after most
careful and mature consideration of the whole subject,
is able to present a plan on which we can all honestly
unite and as one phalanx move forward to victory.</p>

<p>I shall not be drawn into premature discussion of the
scheme presented by the report of the Committee on
Reconstruction. I speak now to the question of time
only. I am sure that report could not have been made
in the last week of March. I am equally sure, that, if
it had been postponed until the last week of May, they
would have made a better one than they made in the
last week of April. I hope, therefore, that the decision
of this question will be postponed as long as possible,
in order that all just influences may come to Congress
from the country, and that Congress itself may be inspired
by the fullest and amplest consideration of the
whole question.</p>

<p>There is the evidence before this Committee,&mdash;we
have not yet seen it together. That evidence ought
to be together; it ought to be before the whole country;
and we should have returning to us from the
country the just influence which its circulation is calculated
to produce. I am sure, that, wherever that evidence
is read, the people will say, Congress is justified<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[Pg 54]</a></span>
in insisting upon security for the future. For that purpose
I presume the evidence was taken; and I hope
Congress will not act until the natural and legitimate
influences from the evidence are felt in their counsels.</p>

<p>Allow me to say, by way of comment on the proposition
of the Senator from Connecticut, that it seems
to me my excellent friend, in bringing it forward, forgot
two things.</p>

<div class="medium">

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Dixon.</span> Probably more than that.</p>

</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Sumner.</span> But two things he forgot were so
great, so essential, that to forget them was to forget
everything. In the first place, he forgot that we had
been in a war; and, in the second place, he forgot that
four million human beings had been changed from a
condition of slavery to freedom. Those two ruling facts
my excellent friend forgot, evidently, when he drew his
proposition. Plainly, he forgot that we had been in a
war, because he fails to make any provision for that
security which common sense and common prudence,
the Law of Nations and every instinct of the human
heart, require should be made. He provides no guaranty.
Sir, the essential thing, at this moment, is a
guaranty. The Senator abandons that. If, like the
Senator, I could forget this terrible war, with all the
blood and treasure it has cost, I, too, could be indifferent
to security for the future; but as that war is
always in my mind, the Senator will pardon me, if I
insist upon guaranties.</p>

<p>I have said that my excellent friend forgets that
four million human beings have been changed in their
condition. Four million slaves have been declared
freemen. By whom, and by what power? By the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[Pg 55]</a></span>
National Government. And let me say, that, as the
National Government gave that freedom, the National
Government must secure it. The National Government
cannot leave the men it has made free to the guardianship
or custody or tender mercies of any other government.
It is bound to take them into its own keeping,
to surround them with its own protecting power,
and invest them with all the rights and conditions
which, in the exercise of its best judgment, seem necessary
to that end. All that the Senator has forgotten.
It is not in his mind. If I could bring myself to such
obliviousness, if I could bathe so completely in the
waters of Lethe as my excellent friend from Connecticut
seems to have done daily in these recent times, I
might, perhaps, join in the support of his proposition.</p>

<div class="medium">

<p>A joint resolution “relative to the attempted assassination of
the Emperor of Russia,” introduced in the House of Representatives
by Hon. Thaddeus Stevens, passed that body, and in the Senate was
referred to the Committee on Foreign Relations.</p>

<p>May 8th, it was reported to the Senate slightly amended, so as to
read:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“<i>Resolved, &amp;c.</i>, That the Congress of the United States of America has
learned with deep regret of the attempt made upon the life of the Emperor
of Russia by an enemy of Emancipation. The Congress sends greeting
to his Imperial Majesty and to the Russian nation, and congratulates
the twenty million serfs upon the providential escape from danger of the
sovereign to whose head and heart they owe the blessings of their freedom.”</p>

</div>

<p>Mr. Sumner, on reporting it, said, that, as it was a resolution which
would interest the Senate, and as perhaps it ought to be acted upon
immediately and unanimously, he would ask that it be proceeded with
at once. There being no objection, he explained it briefly.</p>

</div>

<p class="dropcap">MR. PRESIDENT,&mdash;This resolution seems scarcely
adequate to the occasion, but the Committee was
content with making the few slight amendments already
approved by the Senate, without interfering further
with the idea or language adopted by the other
House, where the resolution originated.</p>

<p>From the public prints we learn that an attempt has
been made on the life of the Emperor of Russia by an<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[Pg 57]</a></span>
assassin,&mdash;maddened against him, so it is said, on account
of his divine effort to establish Emancipation.
Of these things I know nothing beyond the report open
to all; but I am not unacquainted with the generous
efforts of the Emperor, and the opposition, if not animosity,
aroused by his perseverance in completing the
good work.</p>

<p>In urging our own duties, I have more than once referred
to this shining example.<a name="FNanchor_27_27" id="FNanchor_27_27"></a><a href="#Footnote_27_27" class="fnanchor">[27]</a> The decree of Emancipation,
in February, 1861, has been supplemented by
an elaborate system of regulations, where Human Liberty
is crowned by the safeguards of a true civilization,
including protection to what are styled civil rights, especially
rights in court,&mdash;then rights of property, with
a homestead for every emancipated serf,&mdash;then rights
of public education; and added to these were political
rights, with the right to vote for local officers, corresponding
to our officers for town and county: all of
which, though just and practical, have encountered obstacles
easily appreciated by us, who are in a similar
transition period. The very thoroughness with which
the Emperor is carrying out Emancipation has aroused
the adversaries of reform, and I think it not improbable
that it was one of these who aimed the blow so happily
arrested. The laggard and dull are not pursued by
assassins.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The Emperor of Russia was born in 1818, and is now
forty-eight years of age. He succeeded to the imperial
throne in 1855. At once, on his accession, he was
inspired to accomplish Emancipation in his extended
empire, stretching from the Baltic to the Sea of Kamtchatka.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[Pg 58]</a></span>
One of his earliest declarations signalized his
character: he would have this great work begin from
above, anxious that it should not proceed from below.
Therefore he insisted that the imperial government
should undertake it, and not leave the blessed change
to the chance of insurrection and blood. He went forward
bravely, encountering opposition; and now that
the decree of Emancipation has gone forth, he still goes
forward to assure all those rights without which Emancipation,
I fear, is little more than a name. Our country
does well, when it offers sincere homage to the
illustrious liberator who has attempted so great a task,
and at such hazard, making a landmark of civilization.</p>

<div class="medium">

<p>Mr. Saulsbury, of Delaware, moved to amend the resolution by
striking out the words “by an enemy of Emancipation,” and advocated
his amendment in a speech. Mr. Sumner replied, that it was
impossible for the Senate to ascertain through a commission the precise
facts in the case,&mdash;that it was an historic case, to be determined by
historic evidence,&mdash;that the same testimony or report from which we
learned the attempt to take the life of the Emperor disclosed also the
character of the assassin,&mdash;and that doubtless the House of Representatives,
from which the resolution came, acted on this authority.
The amendment was rejected, and the resolution was passed without
a division.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Hon. Gustavus V. Fox, Assistant Secretary of the Navy, was sent
to Russia in the ironclad Miantonomoh, charged with the communication
of this resolution to the Emperor. He was received with much
distinction and hospitality. The visit was subsequently described in
a work entitled “Narrative of the Mission to Russia, in 1866, of the
Hon. Gustavus Vasa Fox, Assistant Secretary of the Navy, from the
Journal and Notes of J. F. Loubat, edited by John D. Champlin, Jr.,
1873.” The mission was entertained brilliantly by Prince Galitzin at
Moscow, August 26th (14th), and it is said that “among the invited
guests at the dinner was the emancipated serf, Gvozdeff, the mayor of
the commune.”<a name="FNanchor_28_28" id="FNanchor_28_28"></a><a href="#Footnote_28_28" class="fnanchor">[28]</a></p>

<p>May 9th, the Senate having under consideration a joint resolution,
which had passed the House of Representatives, to prevent the introduction
of cholera into the ports of the United States, Mr. Sumner
said:&mdash;</p>

</div>

<p class="dropcap">MR. PRESIDENT,&mdash;I must say, that, reflecting
upon this question, I find that I travelled with
my friend from Maine [Mr. <span class="smcap">Morrill</span>] through his inquiries
and his doubts, but it was only to arrive substantially
at the conclusion of my friend from Vermont
[Mr. <span class="smcap">Edmunds</span>]. I thought that the criticism of my
friend from Maine was in many respects, at least on
its face, just. I went along with him, and yet I hesitated
in adopting the conclusion he seemed to intimate.
I doubt, if we proceed under the House resolution,
whether we shall do the work thoroughly. I
doubt whether that resolution can be made sufficiently
effective. Indeed, I may go further, and say I am satisfied
that it will not be efficient for the occasion. We
then have the substitute proposed by our own Committee.
Against that there is certainly the remark to
be made, that it is novel. I am not aware that any<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[Pg 60]</a></span>
such proposition has ever before been brought forward;
but certainly it has in its favor the great argument
of efficiency. Yet the question remains behind,
to which the Senator from Maine has directed attention,&mdash;whether
this proposition is not something more
than even a novelty,&mdash;whether it is not a departure
from just principles. I am not inclined to say that
it is anything more than a novelty. I admit that it
is such. It does invest the Government with large
and perhaps unprecedented powers, in order to meet
a peculiar case, where a stringent remedy must be applied.</p>

<p>But, as the Chairman of the Committee on Commerce
suggests, the powers are temporary. I am not
ready to say that such powers cannot be intrusted to
the Government. I believe they can be. But while
I agree in that, and am ready to vote accordingly, yet
I should like to know from the Chairman why these
powers are to be placed under the direction of the
Secretary of War rather than of the Secretary of the
Treasury.</p>

<div class="medium">

<p>Mr. Chandler, of Michigan, the Chairman, said that they were
placed jointly in three Secretaries, the Secretary of War, the Secretary
of the Navy, and the Secretary of the Treasury. After briefly
considering this organization, Mr. Sumner proceeded further.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>May 11th, Mr. Sumner spoke again.</p>

</div>

<p>I should not say anything now, but for the remarks
of my friend from New York [Mr. <span class="smcap">Harris</span>],
who seemed at a loss where to find the power it is
proposed to exercise. He was so much at a loss that
he went beyond the bounds he usually prescribes for
himself in this Chamber, and indulged in unwonted<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[Pg 61]</a></span>
jocularity. Not content with showing, as he supposed,
that the power did not exist where it was said to exist,
he asked, with ludicrous face, whether it was not
found under the clause to guaranty a republican form
of government. I am very glad to find that my excellent
friend is looking to that clause of the Constitution.
It is a clause very much neglected, but to
my mind one of the most potent in the whole Constitution,&mdash;full
of beneficent power, which it would be
well, if the Government, at this crisis of its history,
were disposed to exercise. Here are waters of healing
for our distressed country. Follow this text in
its natural and obvious requirements, and you will
have security, peace, and liberty under the safeguard
of that great guaranty, the Equal Rights of All.</p>

<p>But I must remind my friend that there is no occasion
for any resort to this transcendent source of power
at the present moment. The power from which this
resolution is derived seems very obvious. My friend
interrupts me to say that it is the war power. I say
it is very obvious, and I will show him in a moment,
that it is not the war power. It is a power that has
been exercised constantly, from the beginning of our
history, with regard to which there can be no question,&mdash;because
it is embodied in one of the clearest
texts of the National Constitution,&mdash;because it has
been expounded by a series of decisions from our Supreme
Court, which are among the most authoritative
in our history. It is the power to regulate commerce.
My friend smiles; but would he smile at the Constitution
of his country?</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“The Congress shall have power to regulate commerce
with foreign nations and among the several States.”</p>

</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[Pg 62]</a></span></p>

<p>By the present resolution it is clearly proposed to
regulate commerce with foreign nations. Have not all
regulations with regard to passengers been under this
power? Have they not all been to regulate commerce
with foreign nations? Can there be any doubt? Is
it not as plain as language can make it? Why, Sir,
ever since I have been in Congress we have had annual
bills for the regulation of passengers coming into
our ports,&mdash;bills of different degrees of stringency,
laying one penalty here and another penalty there, all
in the execution of this unquestionable power.</p>

<div class="medium">

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Grimes.</span> Will the Senator be kind enough to look
at the second clause of the amended proposition, where it
says,&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“That he”&mdash;</p>

</div>

<p class="noindent">that is, the Secretary of War&mdash;</p>

or within the limits of the United States”:&mdash;</p>

</div>

<p class="noindent">not confining it to the lines between the States, but giving
him authority to establish cordons within the jurisdiction
of a State. I should like to know where the Constitution
authorizes such a thing as that.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Sumner.</span> I am obliged to my friend even for interrupting
me to call attention to that section, though he will
pardon me, if I do not answer him at this moment, but
when I come to that part of the resolution.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Grimes.</span> Any time will do, so that we get it.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Sumner.</span> You will have it all.</p>

</div>

<p>I am dwelling now on the power derived from the
positive text of the Constitution to regulate commerce
with foreign nations. I say, that, in the execution of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[Pg 63]</a></span>
that power, we have undertaken to apply all manner
of restrictions and regulations to the transportation of
passengers. We have gone so far as to provide for the
quantity of water on board each ship in proportion to
every passenger. We have subjected every ship to regulations
while at sea, and again to other regulations
after arriving in port. The exercise of the power is
by practice placed absolutely beyond question. Then
it is intrenched in the very best judicial decisions of
our country. I submit that no person can raise a question
with regard to it.</p>

<div class="medium">

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Morrill.</span> About regulating the importation of passengers
from foreign countries nobody raises a question or
a doubt. This is a question of quarantine, in its character
police. Is there any precedent in the history of the United
States where that power has been exercised by the General
Government?</p>

</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Sumner.</span> I am very glad the Senator presses
that question. I meet it. Does the Senator mean to
suggest that the same power that can reach the sea,
and determine even the quantity of water in the hold
for each passenger, cannot apply the minutest possible
regulation when that same ship arrives in the harbor?</p>

<div class="medium">

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Morrill.</span> Will my friend allow me to answer him
right there?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Sumner.</span> Certainly.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Morrill.</span> I maintain, that, when the passenger is
landed, and comes within the limits and jurisdiction of the
State, and within its police power, the commercial power of
the Government ceases at that point, and the treatment of
the passenger thereafter is within the police power of the
State exclusively.</p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[Pg 64]</a></span>
<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Sumner.</span> I think the Senator goes beyond the decision
of the Supreme Court. He overrules that decision.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Morrill.</span> I am precisely on a line with the License
cases, in which the principle was applied to the importation
of liquors.</p>

</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Sumner.</span> At a certain stage, I admit, the police
power of the State may intervene; but I do nevertheless
insist, as beyond question, that the power of the United
States is complete over every passenger vessel arriving
in the harbor, so that it may be subjected to any regulations
in the discretion of Congress for the public good
with reference to passengers. Of course, this discretion
is to be exercised wisely for the public good, that the
public health may not suffer. Strange, if the National
Government, which is our guardian against foreign foes,
may not protect us against this fearful enemy.</p>

<div class="medium">

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Morrill.</span> I do not deny that; I agree to that.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Sumner.</span> Very well.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Morrill.</span> Now my query is, Can the power of commerce,
that power which regulates the passengers on their
passage to this country, follow the passengers entirely into
the States and overrule the internal police of the States?
That is the question.</p>

</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Sumner.</span> The Senator puts a question running
into that already propounded by the Senator from Iowa,
and to which I was coming in due course of time. I
have already arrived at it. I was illustrating the power
that the Government would have in the harbor; and
now let me give another illustration, familiar to my
friend: it is with reference to goods. I need not remind
the Senator, that, when goods arrive, subject to
duties, the custom-house exercises its control, according<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[Pg 65]</a></span>
to the prescription of law, not only while the goods
are water-borne, but after they have been landed; and
if they have been landed in violation of the law, it
pursues them even into the interior.</p>

<div class="medium">

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Chandler.</span> To the Rocky Mountains.</p>

</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Sumner.</span> It is enough to say that it pursues
them into the interior. The National Constitution was
not so absurd, nor have our courts been so absurd in its
interpretation, as to recognize a power in the custom-house
merely at the door of the granite structure, and
to require that it shall stop there. No, Sir: the power
must be made effective. We have made it effective
with reference to goods. We have also, to a certain
extent, made it effective, through decisions of the Supreme
Court, with reference to passengers. It remains
that we should carry it one stage further, and, for the
public weal, and to secure the public health, which is
a large part of the public weal, insist that this same
power shall be invoked as in the pursuit of goods. I
cannot see the difference between the two cases. I cannot
doubt that the power over goods imported at our
custom-house under Acts of Congress and the power
over passengers introduced into this country under Acts
of Congress are both derived from the same source, and
you can find no limitation for one and no expansion for
one which is not equally applicable to the other. I insist,
therefore, that on this simple text you find ample
power. You must annul the text, or at least limit it by
construction and dwarf its fair proportions, or the power
of Congress to provide against cholera is perfect.</p>

<p>But as Senators have such scruples about the second
clause of the resolution,&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[Pg 66]</a></span></p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“That he shall also enforce the establishment of sanitary
cordons to prevent the spread of said disease from
infected districts adjacent to or within the limits of the
United States,”&mdash;</p>

</div>

<p>I will add, this clause may be treated under two different
heads,&mdash;first, as ancillary, from the nature of
the case, to the power under the clause to regulate
commerce with foreign nations. From the nature of
the case, if you have the power to shut out cholera
from the ports, you must be intrusted with an associate
power to follow this same enemy even into the
interior, precisely as you follow goods escaping the exercise
of your power in the ports. I am willing, therefore,
to put it even on the first clause of the constitutional
provision, calling it simply ancillary. But I
do not stop there; for, associated with this clause, and
constituting part of the provision, are the words, “and
among the several States.” Congress has power to regulate
commerce among the several States. Now, Sir,
assuming that commerce is, as described or defined by
our Supreme Court, intercourse among men, embracing
the transportation, not only of goods, but of passengers,
and applicable to everything that comes under the
comprehensive term “intercourse,”&mdash;giving to it that
expansive definition which I think you will find in
the decisions of the Supreme Court, I ask you if there
is not under that second clause ample power also to
regulate this matter. Congress has power to regulate
commerce, communication, intercourse, transportation
of freight and transportation of passengers among
the several States. To make that effective, you must
concede a power such as appears in the clause to
which the Senator from Iowa has directed my attention.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[Pg 67]</a></span>
There is no reference here to State lines; and
why? From the necessity of the case. The disease
itself does not recognize State lines. The authority
which goes forth to meet the disease must be at least
on an equality with the disease, and can recognize no
State lines. How vain to set up State rights as an
impediment to this beneficent power!</p>

<p>I therefore conclude that the power over this subject
is plenary, whether you look at the first clause
of the Constitution to which I have called attention,
relating to foreign commerce, or the second clause, relating
to commerce among the States. It is full; it
is complete. Hence I put aside the constitutional objection,
whether used seriously or jocosely, as it was
perhaps by my friend from New York; I put it aside
as absolutely out of the question and irrelevant. Congress
has ample power over this whole subject. And,
Sir, permit me to ask, if it had not ample power over
it, where should we be as a government at this time?
Can we confess that a great government of the world
must fold its arms, and see a foreign enemy&mdash;for such
it is&mdash;crossing the sea and invading our shores, yet
we unable to meet it? I do not believe that this transcendent
republic is thus imbecile. I believe, that, under
the text of the National Constitution, as well as
from the nature of the case, it has ample powers to
meet such enemy.</p>

<p>And this brings me, Sir, to the proposed amendment
of the Senator from Vermont [Mr. <span class="smcap">Edmunds</span>].
He moves to strike out the clause to which I called
attention the other day, and to substitute certain words
creating a commission. I objected to this clause the
other day; I will read it now:&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[Pg 68]</a></span></p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“That it shall be the duty of the Secretary of War, with
the coöperation of the Secretary of the Navy and the Secretary
of the Treasury, whose concurrent action shall be directed
by the Commander-in-Chief of the Army and Navy, to
adopt an efficient and uniform system of quarantine against
the introduction into this country of the Asiatic cholera.”</p>

</div>

<p>I objected, it may be remembered, to this clause, as
placing the bill under the patronage of the war power.
I did not think it needed that patronage, though I was
willing to admit that it might need sometimes the
exercise of the war authority; but I did not think it
needed to be derived from the war power. It was not
from the nature of the case an exercise of this power,
but it was clearly derived from the power over the
commerce of the country; and I regretted, therefore,
that the framers of the bill had seemed to put the war
power in the forefront. The Senator from Vermont
meets that suggestion by an amendment to the effect
that a commission shall be constituted, embracing the
Secretary of War, the Secretary of the Navy, and the
Secretary of the Treasury. I have no particular criticism
to make upon the amendment. If the Senate
consent to it, I shall certainly be disposed to join.
But I think a better form still may be adopted, and
one placing what we do more completely and unreservedly
under that power of the Constitution from
which I think it is derived,&mdash;that is, the power to
regulate commerce. I would therefore propose that the
duty shall be confided primarily to the Secretary of the
Treasury, who, in the exercise of his powers, shall be
aided by the Secretary of War and the Secretary of
the Navy, under the direction of the President of the
United States.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[Pg 69]</a></span></p>

<p class="center">…</p>

<p>In making this change, we shall simply enlarge and
expand the existing powers of the Secretary of the
Treasury. He is now the head of the custom-house;
he regulates the passenger system. Go further, and
give him these additional powers, that shall enable
him, so far as he can, to prevent the introduction of
disease into the country. All that we do will be in
harmony with the practice of the Government, and I
believe above question. The Government, in the exercise
of admitted powers, will be, I trust, more than
a match for the cholera.</p>

<div class="medium">

<p>May 15th, Mr. Reverdy Johnson replied, when Mr. Sumner rejoined:&mdash;</p>

</div>

<p>The Senator from Maryland has referred us to the
decisions of the Supreme Court which in his opinion
bear directly on this point; but, Sir, with the ingenuity
of a practised lawyer, he has omitted to remind
us of that decision which, perhaps, of all others, is the
most applicable. With the permission of the Senate,
I will make up for the deficiency of the learned Senator,
or at least endeavor to do so. I refer to the case
of <i>The United States</i> v. <i>Coombs</i>, in the twelfth volume
of Peters’s Reports. There you will find one of the
able and well-considered judgments of the late Mr.
Justice Story, particularly treating this question. By
“this question” I mean the power of Congress under
the National Constitution to regulate commerce with
foreign nations and among the several States. I will
read a passage from his judgment, page 78:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“The power to regulate commerce includes the power to
regulate navigation, as connected with the commerce with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[Pg 70]</a></span>
foreign nations and among the States. It was so held and
decided by this court, after the most deliberate consideration,
in the case of <i>Gibbons</i> v. <i>Ogden</i>, 9 Wheaton, 189 to
198.”</p>

</div>

<p>All that the Senator will of course recognize; for,
indeed, he has admitted as much in what he has said
and cited. The learned judge then proceeds:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“It does not stop at the mere boundary-line of a State;
nor is it confined to acts done on the water, or in the necessary
course of the navigation thereof. It extends to such
acts, done on land, which interfere with, obstruct, or prevent
the due exercise of the power to regulate commerce
and navigation with foreign nations and among the States.
Any offence which thus interferes with, obstructs, or prevents
such commerce and navigation, though done on land,
may be punished by Congress, under its general authority
to make all laws necessary and proper to execute their delegated
constitutional powers.”</p>

</div>

<p>Those are the pointed words of Mr. Justice Story.</p>

<div class="medium">

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Morrill.</span> Will the Senator allow me to ask him a
question?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Sumner.</span> Certainly.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Morrill.</span> That is, to regulate commerce.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Sumner.</span> To regulate commerce.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Morrill.</span> Does the Senator mean to be understood
that a regulation in regard to cholera, a disease, is a regulation
of commerce?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Sumner.</span> I do, certainly.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Morrill.</span> Then the cholera is commerce?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Sumner.</span> No; cholera is not commerce, but cholera
comes from passengers.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Morrill.</span> Then is the regulation of it commerce, or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[Pg 71]</a></span>
is it the treatment of a disease? Is it a regulation of health,
or a regulation of commerce?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Sumner.</span> It is connected with commerce, and must
be treated in its appropriate connection.</p>

</div>

<p class="center">…</p>

<p>Nor do I understand that this is an exercise of power
for the first time. It is nothing more than a new application
of an old power, or an expansion of an old
power to a new condition of circumstances, and perhaps
I may say enlarging the old power, because the
circumstances require the enlargement. I do not understand
that any new fountain is opened. No new
source is drawn upon; no new principle is invoked.
We go back to the original text so often applied in
kindred cases, and insist upon its application now.</p>

<p>If I understand the argument of the Senator, it is
that all quarantine regulations belong to the States
exclusively. Am I right in that?</p>

<div class="medium">

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Morrill.</span> Most of them.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Sumner.</span> The Senator, I understand, says they belong
exclusively to the States.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Morrill.</span> Yes.</p>

</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Sumner.</span> If I carry the idea of the Senator
still further, it would be to say that the Government
of the United States might make all possible regulations
with reference to passengers water-borne, but
could not touch them with any sanitary regulation the
moment they entered our harbors. Such is the inevitable
conclusion; and permit me to say, it is an
absurdity. I will not consent thus to despoil the National
Government of a power which to my mind seems
so essential to the national health.</p>

<div class="medium">

<p>After quoting the statute of February 25, 1799, entitled “An Act
respecting Quarantines and Health Laws,” by which United States
officers are directed to assist State officers in enforcing the quarantine,
Mr. Sumner proceeded:&mdash;</p>

</div>

<p>Now I submit that this statute of 1799 relating to
quarantine contains a jumble or confusion not unlike
that in the Fugitive Slave Act of 1793,&mdash;that is, a
recognition of a concurrent jurisdiction in the State
and National Governments over this question. The
measure now before the Senate would follow out the
general principle or reasoning of later years, and assure
the jurisdiction to the Federal, or, as I always like to
call it, the National power. It would secure it to the
National power; and to my mind it properly belongs
to the National power, and no ingenuity of the Senator
from Maine can satisfy me that it should not be intrusted
to the National power. It is essentially a National
object, and can be performed effectively and
thoroughly only through the National arm. If you
intrust it to the different local authorities, you will
have as many systems as you have States or communities,
and you cannot bring your policy to bear with
that unity which it ought to have in dealing with so
deadly a foe. You should be able to carry into this
business something of the combination and directness
of war. At the same time I beg to say, as I have
heretofore said, that I do not recognize this in any
respect as a military remedy. I treat it absolutely
as commercial; I derive it from a commercial power;
and by the amendment which I have introduced I
would place it under the direction of the Secretary
of the Treasury.</p>

<p class="plabeln"><span class="smcap">Speeches in the Senate, on an Amendment to the Consular
and Diplomatic Bill, authorizing Envoys Extraordinary
and Ministers Plenipotentiary instead of Ministers Resident,

<div class="medium">

<p>May 16th, the Senate having under consideration the bill making
appropriations for the consular and diplomatic expenses for the ensuing
year, Mr. Sumner moved the following amendment:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“<i>Provided</i>, That an envoy extraordinary and minister plenipotentiary
appointed at any place where the United States are now represented by a
minister resident shall receive the compensation fixed by law and appropriated
for a minister resident, and no more.”</p>

</div>

<p>Mr. Sumner then said:&mdash;</p>

</div>

<p class="dropcap">I should like to make a brief explanation of this
amendment. It will be perceived that it comes
after the appropriation for salaries of envoys extraordinary
and ministers plenipotentiary and ministers resident.
Its object, in one word, is to authorize the Government,
in its discretion, to employ persons with the
title of envoy extraordinary and minister plenipotentiary
where it now employs ministers resident, but
without any increase of salary. This subject has occupied
the attention of the Committee on Foreign Relations
for several years; it has been more than once before
the Senate. The Committee were unanimous that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[Pg 75]</a></span>
the good of the service, especially in Europe, required
this change. From authentic information it appears
that our ministers at courts where they have only the
title of ministers resident play a second part to gentlemen
with the higher title, though representing governments
which we should not consider in worldly rank
on an equality with ours. They are second to them;
in short, to use a familiar illustration, and simply to
bring the difference home, when they call upon business
or appear anywhere, they bear the same relation
to the envoys extraordinary of those smaller governments
that a member of the other House, calling upon
the President, bears to Senators. The Senator is admitted,
when the member of the other House, as we
know, waits.</p>

<p>I hold in my hand the last Almanac of Gotha, for
1866, which is the diplomatic authority for the world,
and has been for a century; and, by way of example, I
turn to the diplomatic list for the Netherlands, where,
it will be remembered, we are represented by a patriotic
citizen, well known to most of us, who was once
connected with the press,&mdash;Mr. Pike,&mdash;with the title
of minister resident. According to the list, I find at
this same court the Grand Duchy of Baden represented
by an envoy extraordinary and minister plenipotentiary;
Belgium, the adjoining country, and with
a population much inferior to our own, represented by
an envoy extraordinary and minister plenipotentiary;
Denmark, a nation which, shorn of the two provinces
of Schleswig and Holstein, has little more than a million
and a half of population, represented by an envoy
extraordinary and minister plenipotentiary. Spain, of
course, is represented by an envoy extraordinary and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[Pg 76]</a></span>
minister plenipotentiary. Even the Grand Duchy of
Hesse is so represented; so is the kingdom of Italy;
so is the Duchy of Nassau; so is Portugal; so is Prussia;
and so others. In transacting business, the American
minister resident at this court is always treated
as second to these representatives. I have alluded to
the relations we bear to the head of the Executive Department
here, as compared with members of the other
House. I doubt not that Senators know there is a positive
business advantage in having access promptly, and
perhaps with a certain consideration which does not
always attach to those of inferior rank.</p>

<p class="center">…</p>

<p>It will be observed that the proposition does not
undertake to empower the President, or to direct him,
to make this change; but it assumes, according to a
certain theory of the Constitution, that under the Constitution
it is in the discretion of the President to send
ambassadors, envoys extraordinary, or ministers resident,
or any other diplomatic functionary, in his discretion,
Congress having only the function of supplying
the means.</p>

<p class="center">…</p>

<p>Now the proposition which I have moved proceeds,
in harmony with this, simply to declare, that, if the
President shall undertake to appoint an envoy extraordinary
and minister plenipotentiary to any court where
we are now represented by a minister resident, the salary
shall be only that of a minister resident. Proceeding
with the theory of this Act and a certain theory of
the Constitution, the President has the power already
to appoint an envoy extraordinary and minister plenipotentiary
to any of these courts, if in his discretion<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[Pg 77]</a></span>
he shall see fit; but there is no salary appropriated by
law. If the amendment now offered should be adopted,
it would be in his discretion to change our representative
from a minister resident to an envoy extraordinary,
but without increase of salary; and the simple
question remains, whether this enabling discretion is
not proper. The President is not called upon to exercise
it. There are places where he may think it better
to continue the minister resident.</p>

<div class="medium">

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Fessenden.</span> He can do it now.</p>

</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Sumner.</span> But there is no salary; the salary
would not apply. The amendment is to supply the
salary in such cases; that is all. I have heard it observed,
that, though the President may now, under the
Constitution, appoint to any place an envoy extraordinary
and minister plenipotentiary, he is restrained in
the exercise of that power by the want of an appropriation
to support the appointment. The present proposition
meets that difficulty precisely.</p>

<div class="medium">

<p>The amendment was opposed by Mr. Fessenden, of Maine, and Mr.
Grimes, of Iowa. Mr. Sumner replied:&mdash;</p>

</div>

<p>I have no feeling on this question at all,&mdash;not the
least; nor do I approach it as a political question. I
see no individual in it. I do not see Mr. Harvey or
Mr. Sanford. I see nobody here to oppose, and nobody
to favor. I know nothing in it but my country and its
service abroad. Sir, I think I am as sensitive as any
other Senator with regard to the just influence belonging
to my country as a republic great and glorious in
the history of mankind. I believe that I am duly proud
of it, and conscious of the weight it ought to carry<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[Pg 78]</a></span>
wherever it appears. I know its name stands for something
in the world, and that whoever represents this
country on the ocean or in the diplomatic service has,
alone, a great and powerful recommendation. But I
also know too much of human history and too much
of human nature, not to know that men everywhere are
influenced more or less by the title of those who approach
them.</p>

<div class="medium">

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Fessenden.</span> Governments are not; men may be.</p>

</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Sumner.</span> But let me remind my friend that
governments are composed of men. He knows well
that the presence of a general on a particular service
produces more certain effect and prompter result than
the presence of a colonel or a major, at least under
ordinary circumstances. My other friend, who represents
the Naval Committee on this floor [Mr. <span class="smcap">Grimes</span>],
knows very well, that, if he sends an admiral on any
service, it may be only of compliment, he produces at
once a greater effect than if he sends a lieutenant.</p>

<p>The Senator has just induced us to send the Assistant
Secretary of the Navy to Europe, because in that
way he might give more <i>éclat</i> to a certain service. I
united with him in the effort. But why not allow a
clerk of the Department to carry our resolution? The
Senator knew full well, if he sent the Assistant Secretary
of the Navy, he should do more than if he sent
a simple clerk of the Department. And therefore I am
brought to the precise point, that, whatever the rank
of our country in the world, and how much soever we
may be entitled, at all courts where our representatives
are, to the highest precedence, yet, such is human
nature, our position is impaired by the title of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[Pg 79]</a></span>
the agent we send. I would give our agent the artificial
accessories and incidents which the Law of Nations
allows. I follow the Law of Nations. Why does
this law authorize or sanction, and why do our Constitution
and statutes, following the Law of Nations, authorize
and sanction, a difference of rank, except to obtain
corresponding degrees of influence? That is the
theory which underlies the gradation of rank. It runs
into the army; it runs into the navy; it runs into Congress;
it runs into all the business of life; and the
simple question is, whether now, in the diplomatic service
of the country, in dealing with our foreign agents,
we shall discard a principle of action followed in everything
else.</p>

<p>The amendment was rejected,&mdash;Yeas 15, Nays 17.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>May 17th, Mr. Sumner renewed his effort, by moving the amendment
in the following form:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“<i>And be it further enacted</i>, That the salary of any envoy extraordinary
and minister plenipotentiary hereafter appointed shall be the salary of a
minister resident, and nothing more, except when he is appointed to one
of the countries where the United States are now represented by an envoy
extraordinary and minister plenipotentiary.”</p>

</div>

<p>After explaining it, Mr. Sumner said, especially in reply to Mr.
Grimes:&mdash;</p>

</div>

<p>I do not like to discuss things forever that have
been discussed so often. I have said so much on this
matter that I feel ashamed to add another word; and
yet, as the Senator from Iowa returns to the assault,
perhaps I should return to the defence.</p>

<p>I tried to show, last evening, that, in introducing this
proposition, I was simply acting on the practice of the
Government in other respects, and upon the practice of
mankind generally, everywhere; and my friend from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[Pg 80]</a></span>
Ohio [Mr. <span class="smcap">Wade</span>] reminds me that the argument of
the Senator from Iowa, a few days ago, was one of the
strongest illustrations of what I said. He induced the
Senate to agree to appoint a new Assistant Secretary
of the Navy, merely to allow the actual Assistant Secretary
to go abroad, because his presence would enhance
the service. Under his argument, yielding to its
pressure, we appointed a new functionary in the Department
of the Navy.</p>

<p>Now, if I can have the attention of the Senator
from Iowa for one moment, I would put him a practical
question. If he had important business, say with
the mayor of New York, which he wished to present
in the best way possible, I have no doubt my friend
would count naturally upon his own character, and
justly; he would believe that any agent sent by him
to the mayor of New York would be well received.
Doubtless he would be well received; yet, if there
were two persons whose services he might employ, one
with the rank of general and the other with the rank
of colonel, but equal in abilities and in fitness, I have
no doubt my friend would select the general rather
than the colonel. From familiarity with human nature,
he knows that the general, on arrival, would
have a prompter reception than the colonel. It is useless
to say, in reply, that behind the agent is the same
personage. I assume all that; but I would secure for
that same personage the best reception possible, and
the highest facilities for his representative. I would
now secure the same thing for my country, and I believe&mdash;pardon
me, if I introduce my own personal testimony&mdash;but
I believe, according to such opportunities
of observation as I have had, now running over a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[Pg 81]</a></span>
considerable period of life, that the interests of the
country would be promoted by this change. I believe
that business would be facilitated, and opportunities of
influence enhanced.</p>

<p>I make no allusion to topics playfully introduced
into this discussion. It is a matter of comparative indifference
what place a man may have at a dinner-table;
but I do wish to secure facilities in business
and respect for the representatives of my country to
the largest degree possible.</p>

<p>May 16th, the Senate having under consideration the bill making
appropriations for the consular and diplomatic expenses, Mr. Sumner
moved an addition of twenty per cent. to the compensation allowed to
the clerks of the State Department. A petition from the clerks was
read. Mr. Sumner then said:&mdash;</p>

</div>

<p class="dropcap">I do not know that there is any necessity for me
to add anything. The petition speaks for itself.
It states the whole case. But a word will not be out
of place with regard to the gentleman who heads the
petition,&mdash;Mr. Hunter. He is one of the oldest public
servants now connected with the Government. He
has been in the Department of State for more than
thirty years. He may be called the living index to
that Department; and I believe I do not err in saying
that in our Blue Book of office there is no person whose
integrity is more generally recognized. Placed in a
position of especial trust, where all the foreign correspondence
of the Government passes under his eye,
that which comes and that which goes, I believe he
has passed a life without blame. He has been in a
position where, had his integrity been open to seduction,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[Pg 83]</a></span>
he might have been tempted. No human being
imagines that he has ever yielded. He has discharged
his very important trusts on a very humble salary. I
think the Senator from Maine [Mr. <span class="smcap">Fessenden</span>] knows
him well enough to know that he has brought to those
functions ability of a peculiar character. And now, in
the decline of life, he finds himself with the small
salary of a clerk, on which he can with difficulty subsist,&mdash;and
yet all the time rendering these important
services and discharging these considerable trusts, absorbed
in the business of the office so that he takes
it home with him nightly. It leaves with him in the
evening and returns with him in the morning, and then
it fills the long day. I think that such a public servant
deserves recognition. I have for some time felt
that his compensation was inadequate. I have thought
that his salary ought to be raised; but, after consideration
of the question in committee, and consultation
with others, it was thought best to present the case
in a general proposition such as I have now moved,
being for the addition of twenty per cent. to the compensation
of all the clerks in the Department. The argument
for this is enforced in the petition from these
gentlemen which has been read at the desk. I can
see no objection to it, especially after what we have
done for the clerks of the Treasury. Are not public
servants at the State Department as worthy as public
servants at the Treasury?</p>

<div class="medium">

<p>The debate showed the indisposition of Senators to any general
addition to the compensation of the clerks of the State Department,
but with recognition of the merits of Mr. Hunter.</p>

<p>May 17th, after conversation and discussion, Mr. Sumner changed
his motion, so as to read:&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[Pg 84]</a></span></p>

annual salary of $3,500, to commence on the first day of July, 1866; and
the amount necessary to pay the same is hereby appropriated.”</p>

</div>

<p>Mr. Sumner then said:&mdash;</p>

</div>

<p>A Senator near me says he will not vote for this
amendment, unless I put in the name. It is perfectly
well known that it is intended as an opportunity to
appoint Mr. Hunter, and the authorities, I presume,
will take notice. There is no need of inserting his

for an excuse. I hope the Senate will adopt the

<p>Mr. Trumbull, of Illinois, recently presented a petition from citizens
of Augusta County, Virginia, which was duly referred, stating
that the Union men in that locality were without protection from the
local authorities, and asking that the military power be not withdrawn.
The petition caused excitement in the neighborhood, accompanied
by threats. Mr. Trumbull had asked to withdraw the petition
and return it to the petitioners, “that they may protect themselves, as
far as this will enable them to do so, against the accusations which
have been brought upon them,” and expressed his regret that he could
not propose some measure for their protection.</p>

<p>Mr. Sumner said:&mdash;</p>

</div>

<p class="dropcap">MR. PRESIDENT,&mdash;I hope the Senate will not
take this step without considering its importance.
I do not mean to oppose it, but I would ask
attention to what I may call its gravity. I am not
aware that a petition has ever before been withdrawn
on a motion like that now made. A petition once
presented comes into the possession of the Senate; it
passes into its files, and into the archives of the Capitol.
We are about to make a precedent for the first
time. I do not say that the occasion does not justify
the precedent. I incline to agree with my friend from
Illinois. We owe protection, so far as we can afford
it, to these petitioners; and since the Senator from Illinois<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[Pg 87]</a></span>
regards this as the best way, I am disposed to
follow him; but in doing it, I wish the Senate to take
notice of the character of the step, and of the precedent
they make.</p>

<p>But this is not all, Sir. I wish the Senate to take
notice that they are called to adopt this exceptional
precedent by the lawless and brutal condition of the
social system about these petitioners. The very fact
which the Senator brings to the attention of the Senate,
and on account of which he invokes an unprecedented
exercise of power, is important evidence on the condition
of things in one of these Rebel States. It goes
to show that they are not yet in any just sense reconstructed,
or prepared for reconstruction. Such an
abnormal fact could not occur in any other part of our
broad country. That it occurs here must be referred
to remains of Rebellion not yet subdued, but which
you are now called upon, in the exercise of powers
under the National Constitution, to overcome and obliterate.</p>

<p>Therefore, Sir, I regard this transaction in a double
light: first, as an important precedent in the business
of the Senate; secondly, as illustrating a condition of
things to justify every exercise of care and diligence
on our part, that it may not bring forth similar fruits
hereafter. The right of petition, a great popular right,
cannot be interrupted without a blow at the Constitution.</p>

<p>May 24th, on motion of Mr. Wilson, of Massachusetts, the Senate
considered a joint resolution to provide for the publication of an
official history of the Rebellion. In the debate that ensued, Mr.
Sumner said:&mdash;</p>

</div>

<p class="dropcap">MR. PRESIDENT,&mdash;We have already in our history
some experience by which we may be taught
on this question. Senators have seen in their libraries,
certainly in the Congressional Library, the large volumes
known as “American Archives,” of which there
are portions of two series. When that collection was
commenced, it was intended that it should embody all
the papers, military and diplomatic, and also leading
articles in newspapers, relating to the origin of our
Revolution and the War of Independence. The collection
proceeded to the year 1776, under the editorship
of Peter Force, of this city, a gentleman as competent,
I suppose, as any person who could have been
selected in the whole country; but it was subject to the
revising judgment of the Secretary of State. Finally,
when Mr. Force had prepared a volume for 1777, and
his papers were collected and laid before the Secretary
of State, at that time Mr. Marcy, the latter functionary<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[Pg 89]</a></span>
refused his assent to any further publication, and the
collection, originally ordered by Act of Congress,<a name="FNanchor_30_30" id="FNanchor_30_30"></a><a href="#Footnote_30_30" class="fnanchor">[30]</a> was
arrested at the year 1776, and primarily because the
Secretary of State declined to give his final assent, as
required under a subsequent Act.<a name="FNanchor_31_31" id="FNanchor_31_31"></a><a href="#Footnote_31_31" class="fnanchor">[31]</a> Such is our experience
with regard to one important portion of our
history, the War of Independence. The documents are
not yet published in one connected series; I do not
know that they ever will be. And now, Sir, it is proposed
to commence another series, promising more expense
even than that of the War of Independence.</p>

<p>I would simply suggest that we may well consider
whether it might not be advisable to complete the
original series, and to illustrate the War of Independence,
before we enter upon the work of illustrating this
recent more terrible conflict. But, Sir, suppose we
undertake the latter work; then I think all that has
been said, particularly by the Senator from Maine [Mr.
<span class="smcap">Fessenden</span>], suggesting caution, care, and editorship, of
infinite importance. I agree with that Senator absolutely,
when he says the whole collection will be of
very little value, it will be trivial, if not well edited,
well arranged, and then well indexed.</p>

<div class="medium">

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Fessenden.</span> And the larger it is, the worse it will
be.</p>

</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Sumner.</span> Of course. Then Senators say that
we must find a competent man. Who is the competent
man? I do not know him now. I dare say he
might come to light, perhaps, if we went about with
a lantern after him; but the competent man to gather<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[Pg 90]</a></span>
together all this mass of documents, to put them in
order, and then to make a proper analytical index,
would be a very rare character. He must be a man
without the turbulent ambition that belongs to politicians,&mdash;disposed
to quiet, willing to live at home
with his books and papers, and give himself day and
night to serious toil. That is the character of man
you would require. I do not know where he could be
found.</p>

<div class="medium">

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Johnson</span> [of Maryland]. You might find him in
Boston.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Sumner.</span> In Boston, if anywhere, perhaps. [<i>Laughter.</i>]
But I do not know him there, I am free to say.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Fessenden.</span> Resign, and take charge of it yourself.
[<i>Laughter.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Sumner.</span> I do not know but that is the best thing
I could do [<i>laughter</i>]; but then I should despair of getting
through the work.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Fessenden.</span> I would agree to serve as your clerk.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Sumner.</span> Then the work would surely be done.
[<i>Laughter.</i>]</p>

</div>

<p>All this brings us to the conclusion that what we
do should be well considered and laid out in advance.
I think, therefore, it is important that the resolution
should be recommitted, that we should have the benefit
of all the information we can obtain from the Department,
and, if possible, provide in advance the method,
the arrangement, and the way in which the collection
should be indexed. As much should be done in advance
as possible. Sir, we may derive instruction on
this subject from what is doing in other nations. At
this moment the French Emperor is publishing the
writings of his uncle, the Emperor Napoleon. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[Pg 91]</a></span>
collection has already proceeded to nineteen or twenty
quarto volumes, elaborately edited, the purpose being
to bring together every scrap, military, diplomatic, or
personal, which can be found proceeding from the First
Napoleon. All is under special editorship. Some of
the first men of France are a committee superintending
it. If we undertake our work, I think we ought
to do as well by it as the Emperor of France does by
the writings of his uncle.</p>

any new road or connection with any other road, without authority from
the State in which said railroad or connection may be proposed.”</p>

</div>

<p>On the third reading of the bill, Mr. Sumner said:&mdash;</p>

</div>

<p class="dropcap">I agree with the Senator from Pennsylvania [Mr.
<span class="smcap">Cowan</span>], that the measure before us is important:
whether so transcendently important as he depicts I
do not venture to say. But, Sir, I believe it a beneficent
measure, and important from its very beneficence.</p>

<p>The bill as originally presented was complete and
simple. I think it met the idea so ably set forth by
the Senator from Ohio [Mr. <span class="smcap">Sherman</span>]. Were the bill<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[Pg 94]</a></span>
adopted in that form, it would be truly beneficent. It
would prevent any State from becoming a turnpike-gate
to the internal commerce of the country.</p>

<p>No State, I insist, has a right to take toll on the
internal commerce of this great republic, and it belongs
to the United States, under the National Constitution,
to regulate that internal commerce. It was
in the exercise of that power, under the National Constitution,
and also of other powers, as the power to
regulate the post-office, and also the military power,
that this bill was conceived. I say, Sir, in every respect
it is beneficent. It has been to-day ably and
conclusively vindicated by the Senator from Ohio. On
other occasions I have considered it. I feel now that
there is little occasion for any further elaborate discussion.
I regret, Sir, with the Senator from Ohio,
that the amendment of the Senator from New Hampshire
has been fastened upon it. I wish it were in our
power now to give the bill its original force and virtue.
But, even with that amendment, it is better than nothing.
It does something. It goes forth and does battle
with a monopoly in at least one State of the Union
which was in view when the bill was first presented.
It is also a precedent for the future action of Congress,
and it will open the way to what the Senator from
Ohio so earnestly desires.</p>

<p>I shall be glad hereafter to act with him in carrying
out the original purposes of this bill, so that no State
shall be able to set itself in the way of the internal
commerce of the country. But, considering that the
amendment is already attached to the bill, that we
have now passed the stage when it would be advisable
to open the discussion again, I hope the Senate will<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[Pg 95]</a></span>
proceed to its final passage. Though shorn of some of
its virtue, it is better than nothing; it will do much
good. Even in its present form it is essentially beneficent.
Therefore I hope it will be adopted.</p>

that correspondence it appears that the United States,
through Mr. Seward, and the Government of Great
Britain, through Lord Lyons, came to an agreement, in
1863, to refer the question of damages in this matter
to Mr. Evarts, the eminent counsel at New York,
and Mr. Archibald, the British consul at New York.
Those two referees have proceeded with the business
and made a report, which forms the basis of this bill.
I call particular attention to the dates, as they had an<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[Pg 97]</a></span>
influence on the judgment of the Committee. I need
not remind the Senate, that, at a later day, Lord Russell,
in a formal manner, declined all arbitration of our
claims on Great Britain. That was by a communication
to Mr. Adams, our minister at Great Britain, bearing
date August 30, 1865. All will remember the
terms of that note, which have been substantially set
forth in the annual message of the President. Had
the case of this vessel arisen subsequently to the
note, it would have been a grave question whether
the Committee could have counselled any present recognition
of the claim; but it was otherwise. The case
occurred and the referees were selected before the
note. Under the circumstances, there was no alternative.
We had selected our court, and the damages
were determined by the judgment of that court. It
only remains for us to abide by the judgment of the
tribunal we have assisted in establishing.</p>

<p>June 28th, the Senate took up a bill from the House to incorporate

<p>“<span class="smcap">Section 28.</span> <i>And be it further enacted</i>, That this Act shall not take

</div>

<p>In the debate that ensued, Mr. Sumner said:&mdash;</p>

</div>

<p class="dropcap">MR. PRESIDENT,&mdash;The Senator from Kentucky
[Mr. <span class="smcap">Guthrie</span>] gives his judgment in favor of
the proposed ship-canal, but he gives his argument
against it. He is in favor of delay, and the reason he
assigns is, that the country is already encumbered by
a large national debt, which we should not increase
by any additional expenditure; and he asks, with a
triumphant air, whether it has ever before been proposed
to reduce a national debt by increasing it. But
his question does not meet the case. It is proposed,
so far as I understand, to provide additional resources.
To that end additional expenditure will be incurred.
Out of the additional resources there will be increased<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[Pg 100]</a></span>
means for the payment of the national debt. This
is the answer to the Senator; and as I understand
him to make no other special objection to proceeding
with the matter now, I feel that he is completely
answered.</p>

<p>I confess, however, Sir, that what fell from the Senator
from Iowa [Mr. <span class="smcap">Grimes</span>] produced more impression
on my mind. His objection to the execution of
this work by a corporation, and to allowing that corporation
to establish tolls which the people of his State
and of other States at the West should be obliged to
pay, certainly deserves attention.</p>

<div class="medium">

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Sherman.</span> And there is the water power.</p>

</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Sumner.</span> Which is to be given to this corporation.
I say it deserves attention. But I think the
Senator is mistaken, when on that account he interposes
the dilatory motion asking the bill recommitted.
I do not know that at a subsequent stage of the debate
it may not be important to recommit it; but I believe
that at this moment we had better proceed with the
bill, and have a vote of the Senate on the amendment
reported by the Committee. For one, I wish an opportunity,
and the sooner the better, to vote against that
amendment. Senators about me say, so do they. Let
us, then, proceed with the bill; and I hope the Senate
will vote down the amendment which is to invite the
consent and coöperation of the State of New York.
On that question the Senate should establish a precedent.</p>

<p>The time has come for us to assert the powers of
the National Government, independent of the States,
in certain cases. The argument in this debate has<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[Pg 101]</a></span>
gone very much on the military power of the Government,
little allusion being made to that other source
of power which seems to me so ample,&mdash;the power to
regulate commerce among the States. I prefer to found
this power upon that text of the National Constitution.
I ask Congress to interpose its power to regulate commerce
among the States,&mdash;to interpose it on a great
occasion, under circumstances, I admit, of special responsibility,
when I consider the time and the occasion,
but under circumstances which amply justify the
exercise of the power. Who, Sir, can doubt, that, under
these special words of the National Constitution, we
have full power over this whole question? Who can
doubt, that, without asking consent of New York, we
may establish a canal about the Falls of Niagara? I
am at a loss to understand how any Senator can hesitate
as to the power of Congress.</p>

<p>Assuming, then, that Congress has the power, the
only remaining question is as to the expediency of
exercising it at this time; and that again brings me
to the argument of the Senator from Kentucky, that
at this time, when we are involved in a large national
debt, we should not undertake to increase it. But to
this I have already replied.</p>

<p>I hope, Sir, there will be no delay,&mdash;that the Senate
will proceed with the bill at once. The question is
great; it is important; it is almost historical; it is
nothing less than to determine whether the northern
shores of Ohio and Illinois shall be brought forward
to the ocean itself, so that the large towns there shall
become ports of the sea. By this ship-canal Chicago
and Cleveland may be made harbors on the Atlantic
coast. Sir, that is an object well worthy of an honest<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[Pg 102]</a></span>
ambition, and I ask the Senate without delay to do
what it can for the great result.</p>

<div class="medium">

<p>After debate, the bill was postponed to the second Tuesday of December.
Though considered at the next session, there was no final
action upon it.</p>

<p>July 3d, the Senate having under consideration a joint resolution,

for the purchase of the law library of the late James L. Pettigru,
of South Carolina, Mr. Sumner said:&mdash;</p>

</div>

<p class="dropcap">I see no objection to this proposition on grounds of
constitutional power. I cannot doubt the power.
Had I been called to vote, when under consideration
some weeks ago, I should have voted in the negative.
I was disposed at that time to look at the purchase
simply as a question of economy. Since then I have
been led to regard it in that other aspect presented by
the Senator from Wisconsin [Mr. <span class="smcap">Howe</span>], and I hesitate
to vote against it.</p>

<p>I have gone over the catalogue of the library. It
is a respectable library for a practising lawyer. Some
of the books are valuable, others may be useful as duplicates.</p>

<p>But in voting this sum I do not expect an equivalent
in the books. I would make the purchase an occasion
of expressing sympathy with courage and fidelity
under peculiar difficulties in the cause of our country.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[Pg 104]</a></span>
Mr. Pettigru was like the angel Abdiel, “among the
faithless faithful only he.” In the State of South Carolina,
and in Charleston itself, he continued true to the
Union in all its trials, early and late,&mdash;first, in those
days when it was menaced by Nullification, and then
again when it was openly assailed by bloody Rebellion.
He died in virtuous poverty, and I am willing that
Congress should make this contribution to his widow.
Such a character is an example of infinite value to the
Republic. I wish to show my respect for it. I should
be glad to see it exalted so as to be seen by men. In
the deserts of the East a fountain is always cherished
as a sacred spot; such a character was a fountain in the
desert. What desert more complete than South Carolina?</p>

<p>The case of Senator Stockton, and the questions which then arose
with regard to the election of Senators, suggested the necessity of legislation
by Congress on this subject. Accordingly a bill was reported
from the Judiciary Committee, “to regulate the times and manner of
holding elections for Senators in Congress.”</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>July 11th, Mr. Fessenden, of Maine, moved an amendment to the
bill, allowing every Legislature to settle the manner of voting, whether
<i>viva voce</i> or by ballot. In the debate that ensued, Mr. Sumner said:&mdash;</p>

</div>

<p class="dropcap">MR. PRESIDENT,&mdash;I was impressed by a remark
of the Senator from Illinois [Mr. <span class="smcap">Trumbull</span>], to
the effect, that, while regulating the election of Senators,
it would be well to require uniformity in all respects.
I was impressed by the remark, for it seemed to me
a key to this whole question. If it be of importance
to require uniformity in all respects, then it seems to
me we should not fail to prescribe in all respects the
manner of the election. Nothing should be left uncertain.
This, I understand, the bill before us undertakes
to do. The amendment of the Senator from Maine, if
adopted, would leave the manner of election in one important
particular open to the caprice of each Legislature,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[Pg 106]</a></span>
so that one Legislature might act in one way and
another in another way,&mdash;one might choose Senators
by open vote, and another by secret vote.</p>

<p>Now, Sir, I remark, in the first place, that there
should be uniformity. The question, then, is, Which
system shall be adopted,&mdash;open voting, or secret voting?
While I am entirely satisfied that at popular elections
secret voting is preferable, and that every citizen,
when about to vote at any such election, has a right to
the protection of secrecy, I do not see my way to the
same conclusion with regard to votes in a representative
capacity. Such votes do not belong to the individual,
if I may so express myself, but to his constituents.
A sound policy requires that the constituent
should be able to see the vote given by the representative;
but that can be only where it is open. This
argument seems to me unanswerable in principle.</p>

<p>Reference has been made to the English system; and
I am glad to adduce it for example, not in the election
of members of Parliament, but in elections by Parliament
itself, as in the choice of Speaker. According
to the principle I have already stated, elections for
members of Parliament should enjoy the protection of
secrecy, which they do not, while the representative
in Parliament should be held to vote in such a way
that his constituents may know what he does, and this
is the English rule. The Speaker of the House of Commons
is chosen by open voting, or <i>viva voce</i>.</p>

<div class="medium">

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Fessenden.</span> We do not do it here in the election of
a President of the Senate.</p>

</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Sumner.</span> But I am disposed to believe that in
not doing it we fail to follow the best example. There<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[Pg 107]</a></span>
is no question now with regard to the manner of voting
at popular elections. Our present question concerns
the manner of voting in a representative capacity, and
here British precedent is in favor of open voting.</p>

<p>The rule at popular elections in our own country
has not been uniform. In some States open voting
has prevailed from the beginning; in others, voting
has been by ballot. The origin of these differences,
while curious historically, is not without interest in
this debate. I think I do not err in saying that the
example of England was early recognized in Virginia
and the more southern States, also in New York after
the withdrawal of Holland. The Western States, including
Kentucky, I need not remind the Senate, were
carved out of Virginia. The great Northwest Territory
was originally part of Virginia, and I presume that the
habit which the Senator from Illinois tells us prevails
throughout that region was derived originally from Virginia,
as the latter State derived it originally from England.
In New England the usage is otherwise; nor
is it difficult to trace its origin. New England borrowed
her system of secret voting at popular elections
from the Puritan corporation which originally planted
its settlements. By the Law of Corporations a majority
governs, and this rule was practically enforced by secret
voting. Here the simplicity of the times harmonized
with classical example. Beans were used for ballots.
A candidate being named, the elector voted by dropping
a black bean or white bean into a box. The rule
at popular elections was carried into elections by the
Legislature. These early settlers were not the first to
employ beans for ballots. The law of Athens enjoined
that their magistrates should be chosen by a ballot of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[Pg 108]</a></span>
beans: so we are told by Lucian, in his Dialogues.<a name="FNanchor_37_37" id="FNanchor_37_37"></a><a href="#Footnote_37_37" class="fnanchor">[37]</a> In
other places voting was by black and white pebbles.<a name="FNanchor_38_38" id="FNanchor_38_38"></a><a href="#Footnote_38_38" class="fnanchor">[38]</a>
These instances, besides showing a curious parallel with
our New England way, illustrate the history of secret
voting.</p>

<p>This brief statement shows the origin of the opposite
rules in popular elections among us,&mdash;the South
and West receiving theirs from Virginia and from England,
and New England receiving hers from the practice
of a Puritan corporation. I ought to mention that
Rhode Island, which was organized under a charter
from Charles the Second, was an exception; but in
other States the original rule of secrecy in popular
elections has prevailed from the beginning.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>There is no question before us with regard to popular
elections. We are considering how men should
vote in a representative capacity. Much as I am in
favor of secret voting at the polls, I cannot hesitate
in declaring for open voting wherever men represent
others. Nor can I see any reason for secrecy in elections
by a legislative body which is not equally strong
for secrecy in voting on the passage of laws. But nobody
would dispense with the ayes and noes in our
daily business. To my mind the question is clear. Republican
institutions will gain by establishing the accountability
of the representative, and I cannot doubt
that this principle should be our guide in determining
the manner of electing Senators under the National
Constitution.</p>

<p>The Senate having under consideration a joint resolution releasing

requiring them to stop at the Sandwich Islands on their route
to Japan and China, Mr. Wilson, of Massachusetts, moved to require,
as a condition of release, the establishment of a monthly mail steamship
line between San Francisco and the Sandwich Islands.</p>

<p>Mr. Sumner said:&mdash;</p>

</div>

<p class="dropcap">MR. PRESIDENT,&mdash;This question is not free from
embarrassment, especially where one is in favor
of the line to Japan, and also in favor of a line to the
Sandwich Islands, as is the case with myself. I am
anxious to see each of these lines established, believing
each important to the general welfare, and especially to
the commercial interests of the country. But, strong
as is my desire, I am not able to see how the line to
Japan can be advantageously held to turn aside and
stop at the Sandwich Islands. To bring these two objects
into one voyage is not unlike the idea of the
elderly person who wished her Bible to be the smallest
size book and the largest size type. The two things
do not go together.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[Pg 111]</a></span></p>

<p>And yet, Sir, I confess that my interest in the
Sandwich Islands inclines me to do all that I can to
strengthen and increase our relations with them. I
do not forget that these islands, though originally discovered
by a British navigator, are mainly indebted for
their present civilization to the United States. Missionaries
of our country have planted churches and
schools at an expense of at least a million dollars.
One of our countrymen, the late John Pickering, of
Boston, the eminent philologist and scholar, invented
the alphabet by which the native language was reduced
to a written text. The whalers of New England have
made these islands a resting-place. Our ships on their
way to China have made them a half-way house. Of
all the foreign ships which reach there five sixths are
of our country. Such are the ties of beneficence and
of commerce by which we are bound to these islands.
No other nation there has an interest comparable in
character or amount to ours. Meanwhile the native
population is constantly decaying, so that I presume
now it is not more than fifty thousand.</p>

<p>This brief review furnishes a glimpse of our interest
in these islands. They are the wards of the United
States. We cannot turn away from them. The Government
must add its contribution also. On this account
I have heard with pleasure that a national ship,
under the command of one of our most intelligent officers,
is to be stationed at the Sandwich Islands. Her
presence will exercise a salutary influence in sustaining
the interests of our people. This is something. But
I confess that I should like to see these islands bound
to our continent by a steam line.</p>

<p>While declaring this desire, with my reasons for it,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[Pg 112]</a></span>
I am not satisfied that it is proper to require the Japan
line to perform this service. It is clear, from unanswerable
testimony, that the stoppage of this line cannot be
effected without such a deviation as materially to interfere
with its operations.</p>

<p>The testimony presented by the report is positive.
Here, for instance, is what is said by that eminent authority,
Admiral Davis:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“These considerations with regard to the eastern voyage
appear to dispose of the whole question. They show that
touching at the Sandwich Islands, on the return from China,
would prolong the voyage so many days unnecessarily that
an additional line of steamers must soon be established, provided
the intercourse between China and America is to acquire
that importance which is confidently expected.”</p>

</div>

<p>This concerns the voyage from Japan to San Francisco.
But Admiral Davis is also against stopping at
the islands on the outward voyage.</p>

<p>It seems clear, then, that the Japanese line, in order
to be effective, and to accomplish what is so much desired,
must be left to itself, without being obliged to
turn aside for any incidental purpose. It must be a
Japanese line, and nothing else; and you must not forget,
that, just in proportion as you impose upon it any
additional obligations, you will impair its efficiency as
one of the splendid links of commerce destined to put
a girdle round the globe.</p>

<p>I am ready, therefore, to release the Japanese line
from stopping at the Sandwich Islands; but at the
same time I declare my hope that some other means
will be found to secure a line to these islands.</p>

<p>In releasing the Company from this service, I am<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[Pg 113]</a></span>
willing to leave to them the full subsidy already appropriated;
but I think they should be held to shorten
their voyage in proportion to the time gained. This
provision will remove an objection which has been
made.</p>

<p class="dropcap">MR. PRESIDENT,&mdash;The question, as I understand

in many respects has the advantage of that from the

glad it sets forth how Tennessee lost her representation
here, and also how she may again be rehabilitated.
But, while according merit to the Senator’s preamble
in that respect, there are other particulars in which it
fails. He himself has already recognized that it is no
better than that of the House, when it sets forth that</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p class="noindent">“the body of the people of Tennessee have, by a proper
spirit of obedience, shown to the satisfaction of Congress

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[Pg 115]</a></span></p>

<p>Here the two preambles are alike; there is no advantage
in one over the other. But I understand the
Senator is willing to alter this clause. If he consents
to the alteration, and the alteration is made, then in
this respect his preamble will be superior to that of
the House. Clearly, Sir, the assumption is false; “the
body of the people of Tennessee have” not, “by a
proper spirit of obedience, shown to the satisfaction of
Congress the return of said State to due allegiance to
the Government, laws, and authority of the United
States.” I may go too far, when I say it is false that
Tennessee has shown a proper spirit, to the satisfaction
of Congress,&mdash;because, if Congress votes that, it
will not be for me, or for any one else, to say it has
voted a falsehood; but I do say Tennessee has not
shown a proper spirit of obedience in the body of her
people. All the evidence which thickens in the air from
that State, and has been darkening our sky during all
this winter, shows that Tennessee has not that spirit
of obedience in the body of her people. Why, Sir,
only this winter, the other House has been constrained
to send a commission to Tennessee to investigate an
outrage of unparalleled atrocity growing out of this
very rebel spirit. How can the Senate aver that the
body of that people, thus saturated with the spirit of
disloyalty, thus set on fire and inflamed by this hatred
to the Union, have shown to the satisfaction of Congress
a proper spirit of obedience? Sir, you err, if
you put in your statute-book any such assertion, which
is historically untrue. You cannot make it true by
your averment. History hereafter, when it takes up
its avenging pen, will record the falsehood to your
shame.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[Pg 116]</a></span></p>

<div class="medium">

<p>Mr. Sumner then adduced evidence of the actual spirit in Tennessee,
when he was interrupted by Mr. Grimes, of Iowa, who referred to the
testimony of generals and civilians. Mr. Sumner continued:&mdash;</p>

</div>

<p>That does not go to the question whether we can
aver that there is a proper spirit of obedience in the
body of her people. No general says there is a proper
spirit of obedience in the body of her people. I challenge
the Senator to cite the testimony showing a
proper spirit of obedience in the body of her people.
Generals testify that in their opinion it would be better
to admit representatives from Tennessee on this
floor and the floor of the other House. That is another
question. Logically, it is not before me yet. I am now
speaking of the erroneous character of this preamble.
But I understand that the Senator from Illinois is willing
to alter his preamble. I believe I am right,&mdash;am
I not?</p>

<div class="medium">

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Trumbull.</span> Yes, Sir; I am willing those words
should go out.</p>

</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Sumner.</span> They ought to go out; and if they
do go out, it will make his preamble in this respect
superior to that from the House.</p>

<p>But there is another allegation in the Senator’s preamble,
which I must say is as erroneous as that on which
I have remarked. He there declares, and calls upon
us to declare, that the constitution adopted by Tennessee
is republican in form. A constitution which
disfranchises more than one quarter of its population
republican in form! What, Sir, is a republican form
of government? It is a government founded on the
people and the consent of the governed. Sir, the constitution
of Tennessee is not founded on the consent<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[Pg 117]</a></span>
of the governed. It cannot invoke in its behalf that
great principle of the Declaration of Independence;
therefore it is not republican in form. And when you
allege that it is republican in form, permit me to say,
you make an allegation false in fact. I do not raise
any question of theory, but I submit that a constitution
which on its face disfranchises more than one fourth
of the citizens cannot be republican in form. You, Sir,
will make a terrible mistake, if at this moment of your
history you undertake to recognize it as such. You
will inflict a blow upon republican institutions. I
hope the Senator from Illinois, as he has consented to
one amendment, will consent to another, and will strike
out the words declaring this constitution republican in
form and in harmony with the Constitution of the
United States. Do not compel us to aver what history
will look at with scorn. Who can doubt, when
this war is considered gravely and calmly in the tranquillity
of the future, that the historian must bring
all these events to the rigid test of principle? Bringing
them to such test, it will be impossible to recognize
any government like that of Tennessee either as
republican in form or in harmony with the National
Constitution.</p>

<div class="medium">

<p>Mr. Trumbull then moved to strike out the first clause objected to,
and insert instead, “and has done other acts proclaiming and denoting
loyalty,” which was agreed to. Mr. Sumner then moved to strike out
the words “republican in form and not inconsistent with the Constitution
and laws of the United States,” which was also agreed to.</p>

<div class="medium">

<p>On motion of Mr. Buckalew, of Pennsylvania, a committee was
appointed to consider the ventilation and sanitary condition of the
Senate wing of the Capitol; and the committee made an elaborate
report.</p>

<p>July 23d, while the Senate had under consideration the bill making
appropriations for sundry civil expenses of the Government, this Senator
moved an amendment appropriating $117,685.25 for improvements
approved and recommended in the report. In the debate that ensued,
Mr. Sumner said:&mdash;</p>

</div>

<p class="dropcap">MR. PRESIDENT,&mdash;The Senator from Pennsylvania
has entitled himself to the gratitude of all
his brethren for the attention he has bestowed upon
an uninviting subject, which concerns the comfort of
the Senate,&mdash;I was about to say, the character of our
legislation; for, while breathing this anomalous atmosphere,
legislation itself must too often suffer with our
bodies. But he will pardon me, if I suggest that he
is not sufficiently radical in his proposition. I am
aware that he is unwilling to be thought radical. The
name is not pleasant to him.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[Pg 120]</a></span></p>

<div class="medium">

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Buckalew.</span> I have no distaste for the name. I
claim to be very radical on some subjects.</p>

</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Sumner.</span> Very well. I hope he will be radical
now,&mdash;in other words, that he will be thorough in his
remedy for the present case.</p>

<p>Catching a phrase from ancient Rome, the Senator
says that the roof over our heads must be destroyed,
as if it were another Carthage. To my mind, this is
not enough; the walls by which we are shut in must
be destroyed. Our present difficulty is less with the
roof than with the surrounding inclosure, separating
us entirely from the open air and the light of day.
Windows are natural ventilators; but we have none.
Let this chamber be brought to the open air and the
light of day, and Nature will do the rest. From its
commanding position on a beautiful eminence, where
every breeze can reach it, the Capitol will have an invigorating
supply from every quarter. I doubt if any
public edifice in the world can compare in site with
that enjoyed by it,&mdash;and I do not forget the monumental
structures of London, Paris, Vienna, or Rome.
But in entering this stone cage with glass above, we
renounce the advantages and opportunities of this unparalleled
situation.</p>

<p>I would have all this massive masonry about us
taken down, and the chamber brought to the windows.
This change would make ventilation easy, and secure
all that the Senator so anxiously recommends. It is
more revolutionary than his plan. It will be expensive,
very expensive, I fear; for the very completeness
of the original work is an impediment to change. This
Capitol, as we all see, is built for immortality. Its<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[Pg 121]</a></span>
disadvantages will not be less permanent than its advantages,
unless we apply ourselves resolutely to their revision.
Without legislation and positive effort on our
part, this chamber will continue uncomfortable for generations
and long centuries. Senators after us, in thickening
ranks, will sit here as uncomfortable as ourselves.
If not for ourselves, then for those who come after us,
we should initiate a change.</p>

<p>Besides bringing this chamber to the windows, its
proportions should be reduced,&mdash;I am disposed to say
one half. A chamber of one half the size would answer
every purpose of business, and not fail essentially
even on occasions of display. Everything is now sacrificed
to the galleries. Senators are treated as the gladiators
of the ancient amphitheatre, not to make “a Roman
holiday,” but a Washington show. As many as fourteen
or fifteen hundred people are constantly gathered
in these galleries. But such surrounding multitudes
are plainly inconsistent with the quiet transaction of
business and the simple tone which belongs to legislation.</p>

<p>I am reminded of the testimony attributed to Sir
Robert Peel, whose protracted parliamentary life made
him an expert. Interrogated by the Committee of the
House of Commons with regard to the proper size for
the new chamber, he replied, that, though the House
consisted of six hundred and fifty-eight members, yet
that full number was rarely in attendance, so that on
common occasions even a small house would not be
filled, and in his judgment the chamber should be constructed
with a view to the daily business rather than
to the infrequent occasions when it would be crowded.
His compendious conclusion was, that the House should<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[Pg 122]</a></span>
be comfortable every day, at the risk of a tight squeeze
now and then. The same idea had been expressed before
by one of the best of early English writers, Thomas
Fuller, who in his proverbs says: “A house had better
be too little for a day than too great for a year”:<a name="FNanchor_43_43" id="FNanchor_43_43"></a><a href="#Footnote_43_43" class="fnanchor">[43]</a>
houses ought to be proportioned to ordinary, and not
extraordinary occasions. In these concurring sayings
I find practical sense.</p>

<p>Plainly the Senate Chamber is too big for our daily
life. It is not proportioned to ordinary occasions or
every-day business. We all know that anything in a
common tone of voice is heard with difficulty, unless
we give special attention. Now I cannot doubt that
the chamber should be so reduced that a motion or
question or remark in a common tone of voice would
be easily heard by every Senator. This should have
been the rule for the architect at the beginning; and
I would have it followed now in the change I suggest.
With seven hundred listeners in the galleries,
and with the large corps of reporters, the public would
be in sufficient attendance, and the business of the
country would be transacted more easily and advantageously.</p>

<p>Looking at these enormous spaces, adapted to the
eye rather than to the ear, I turn with envy to that
other chamber where the Senate sat so many honorable
years, and listened to speeches which now belong to
the permanent literature of the country. I doubt if
any Senator who remembers that interesting chamber
would not prefer it to this amphitheatre. For the
transaction of daily business it was infinitely superior;
and even on rare occasions, when the republic hung<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[Pg 123]</a></span>
upon the voice of the orator, there were witnesses
enough. The theory of our institutions was satisfied.
The public was not excluded, and there were reporters
to communicate promptly what was said.</p>

<p>July 25th, the Senate having under consideration the bill making

of California, moved the following amendment:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“To provide for a survey of the Isthmus of Darien, under the direction
of the War Department, with a view to the construction of a ship-canal,
in accordance with the report of the Superintendent of the Naval Observatory
to the Navy Department, $40,000.”</p>

</div>

<p>In the debate that ensued, Mr. Sumner remarked:&mdash;</p>

</div>

<p class="dropcap">I have had the advantage of cursorily examining
the able and interesting report on this work by
Admiral Davis. It is learned and instructive, and develops
the importance of such a canal to the commerce
of the United States. I need not remind you that California
is necessarily interested, because it is across the
Isthmus of Darien that we reach the distant part of
our own country. Therefore this is to increase and
extend the facilities of communication with a part of
our own country. Unhappily, we are obliged to go
outside of our own borders, but I do not know that
it becomes on that account any the less important.</p>

<p>The Senate will easily see not only its practical<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[Pg 125]</a></span>
value, but also its grandeur in an historical aspect.
From the time of Charles the Fifth, one of the aspirations
of Spain, and indeed of all adventurers and
navigators in those seas, has been to find what was
often called “the secret of the strait,” being a natural
gate by which to pass from ocean to ocean. The proposition
now is, not to find, but to make, a gate by which
this object may be accomplished.</p>

<p>We may well be fascinated by the historic grandeur
of the work; but I am more tempted by its practical
value in promoting relations between distant parts of
our own country and in helping the commerce of the
world. But the pending proposition is simply to provide
for surveys. There is no appropriation for the
work. We do not bind ourselves in the future. Such
an appropriation, whether regarded in a practical, scientific,
or historic light, is amply commended. I shall
gladly vote for it.</p>

<p>On the presentation of the credentials of Hon. David T. Patterson

take the oaths required by Act of Congress and the rule of the Senate.<a name="FNanchor_44_44" id="FNanchor_44_44"></a><a href="#Footnote_44_44" class="fnanchor">[44]</a>

Stark, of Oregon.<a name="FNanchor_45_45" id="FNanchor_45_45"></a><a href="#Footnote_45_45" class="fnanchor">[45]</a> Afterwards, in reply to Mr. Grimes, of Iowa, he
said:&mdash;</p>

</div>

<p class="center">…</p>

<p class="dropcap">But, Sir, there was something that fell from the
Senator from Iowa to which I would make a
moment’s reply. He imagines, that, if we make this
reference, we shall establish a dangerous precedent;
and he even goes so far as to imagine the possibility
that he or his colleague, arriving from the patriotic
State of Iowa, may find their credentials called in
question. Sir, the Senator forgets for a moment the
history of the country: he forgets that we have just
emerged from a great civil war,&mdash;that the State of
Tennessee took part in that war,&mdash;and that the very
question now under consideration is, whether the gentleman
presenting himself as a Senator was compromised
by that war.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[Pg 127]</a></span></p>

<p>If in the State of Iowa there should unhappily be
a rebellion, and if public report should announce that
our patriot friend had taken part in it to such an extent
as to sit on the bench as a judge, enjoying its
commission and swearing allegiance to it, then should
he present himself with credentials as a Senator, I
think we should be justified in asking an inquiry; and
that is the extent of what I ask now. I take the case
the Senator from Iowa supposes, but remind you of
well-known facts which he omits; and there, permit
me to say, is the whole question. If the case of Tennessee
were an ordinary case, like that of Iowa, there
would be no occasion and no justification for inquiry.
But it is not an ordinary case; it is a case incident
to the anomalous condition of public affairs at this
moment. It cannot be treated according to the ordinary
rule; it is a new case, and to meet it we must
make a new precedent.</p>

<p>The Senator is much afraid of precedents. Sir, I
am not afraid of any precedent having for its object
the protection of right; and just in proportion as new
circumstances arise must they be met by a new precedent.
New circumstances have arisen, and you are
called on to meet them frankly, simply.</p>

<p>The question of admitting Nebraska as a State followed that of Colorado,

equal rights without distinction of color in the constitution of the new

the discussion on these two cases prepared the way for the requirement
of equal suffrage in the Rebel States.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>July 27th, Mr. Wade, of Ohio, Chairman of the Committee on Territories,
moved to proceed with the bill for the admission of the State
of Nebraska into the Union, and urged its passage. Mr. Sumner followed.</p>

</div>

<p class="dropcap">MR. PRESIDENT,&mdash;I am very sorry to occupy
the attention of the Senate even for one minute,
but I shall be very brief. The Senator [Mr.
<span class="smcap">Wade</span>] tells us that the majority of the people in
favor of the State government was about one hundred
and fifty; and by such a slender, slim majority you are
called to invest this Territory with the powers and prerogatives
of a State. The smallness of the majority is
an argument against any present action; but, going
behind that small majority, and looking at the number
of voters, the argument increases, for the Senator<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[Pg 129]</a></span>
tells us there were but eight thousand voters. The
question is, Will you invest those eight thousand voters
with the powers and prerogatives now enjoyed in this
Chamber by New York and Pennsylvania and other
States of this Union? I think the objection on this
account unanswerable. It would be unreasonable for
you to invest them with those powers and prerogatives
at this time.</p>

<p>But, Sir, I confess that with me the prevailing objection
is, that the State does not present itself with
a constitution republican in form, and on this question
I challenge the deliberate judgment of my excellent
friend, the Senator from Ohio, who is now trying
to introduce this Territory into the Union as a State.
I challenge the distinguished Senator to show that a
constitution which disqualifies citizens on account of
color can be republican in form. Sir, I say it is not
a republican government, and I am sorry that my distinguished
friend lends his countenance to a government
of such a character. I wish that my friend
would lift himself to the argument that such a government
cannot be republican, and must not be welcomed
as such on this floor.</p>

<p>I forbear entering into the argument. Again and
again I have presented it. Senators have made up
their minds. Each must judge for himself. It is not
without pain and trouble that I find myself constrained
to differ from valued friends and associates, with whom
I am always proud to agree; but I cannot recognize
a constitution with the word “white” as republican.
With such conviction, it is my duty to oppose the
welcome of this Territory as a State just so long as
I can.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[Pg 130]</a></span></p>

<div class="medium">

<p>Mr. Wade said in reply: “It is republican in form, but is not that
kind of republicanism that I approve of. If I had my way about it,
nobody would be excluded from the franchise that was a male citizen
of proper age, let his color be what it would. That would be the
color of republicanism that I should like the best. But to deny that
under the Constitution of the United States this constitution is republican
in form is to deny that we have a republic at all.… The
State of Massachusetts is a little forward on this subject. I am glad
of it.”</p>

<p>Mr. Hendricks, of Indiana, Mr. Doolittle, of Wisconsin, Mr. Pomeroy,
of Kansas, Mr. Howard, of Michigan, Mr. Garrett Davis, of Kentucky,
Mr. Kirkwood, of Iowa, Mr. Buckalew, of Pennsylvania, Mr.
Yates, of Illinois, Mr. Nye, of Nevada, and Mr. Edmunds, of Vermont,
took part in the debate. In the course of Mr. Nye’s remarks,
the following occurred.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Nye.</span> But my conscientious friend from Massachusetts, I am terribly
afraid, mistakes twinges of dyspepsia for constitutional scruples.

This word “white” is the nightmare of his mind.</p>

</div>

<p>Mr. Wade, speaking again, said: “The Senator from Massachusetts
has a certain one idea that covers the whole ground.… All
the opposition that he really has to it is because they put the word
‘white’ in their constitution.”</p>

<p>Mr. Sumner moved the proviso already moved on the Louisiana
and Colorado bills, requiring as a fundamental condition that within
the State there should be no denial of the elective franchise or of
any other right on account of race or color, and that this condition
should be ratified by the voters of the Territory; which was lost,&mdash;Yeas
5, Nays 34. The Senators voting yea were Mr. Edmunds, of
Vermont, Mr. Fessenden, of Maine, Mr. Morgan, of New York, Mr.
Poland, of Vermont, and Mr. Sumner.</p>

<p>The bill then passed the Senate,&mdash;Yeas 24, Nays 18. It also

of the President.</p>

<p>Instead of undoing, let us do always; nor is there
any lack of measures deserving attention. There is
the Bankrupt Bill, practical and beneficent in character,
and involving no sacrifice of Human Rights. This
is a measure of real humanity, calculated to carry
tranquillity and repose into the business of the country.
Besides, it has been too long postponed.</p>

<div class="medium">

<p>Mr. Wade replied with some warmth, when the following passage
occurred.</p>

</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Sumner.</span> Mr. President, I hope to be pardoned,
if I make one word of reply to the Senator. He seemed
to think his argument advanced by personal allusions
to myself. If I understand him, he sought to show
inconsistency on my part.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[Pg 132]</a></span></p>

<div class="medium">

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Wade.</span> Yes, I think I did.</p>

</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Sumner.</span> I am at a loss to understand how the
Senator can find inconsistency, unless he chooses to
misunderstand facts. He assumed that I voted for the
admission of Tennessee.</p>

<div class="medium">

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Wade.</span> When you said you did not, I gave it up.</p>

</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Sumner.</span> My name is recorded, on all the yeas
and nays, and they were numerous, against the admission
of Tennessee; and the reason I assigned was, that
the constitution contained the word “white.”</p>

<div class="medium">

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Wade.</span> You voted for the Constitutional Amendment.</p>

</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Sumner.</span> Yes, I did vote for the Constitutional
Amendment, in its final form;<a name="FNanchor_46_46" id="FNanchor_46_46"></a><a href="#Footnote_46_46" class="fnanchor">[46]</a> but does the Senator
consider himself bound to admit a Rebel State refusing
the suffrage to freedmen? I wish my friend to answer
that.</p>

<div class="medium">

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Wade.</span> No, I do not.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Sumner.</span> I knew he did not.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Wade.</span> I do not know that I understand the Senator.
Let me say that I should consider myself bound by
the Constitutional Amendment, if the Southern States complied
with it within a reasonable time; and that reasonable
time, in my judgment, is nearly elapsed.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Sumner.</span> Even with the word “white” in a constitution?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Wade.</span> Without regard to that.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Sumner.</span> Without regard to the rights of the freedman?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Wade.</span> On complying with the requisitions of the
Constitutional Amendment, I should vote for them.</p>

</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[Pg 133]</a></span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Sumner.</span> I do not agree with the Senator. I
distinctly stated, when the Amendment was under discussion,
that I did not accept it as a finality, and that,
so far as I had a vote on this floor, I would insist that
every one of these States, before its Representatives
were received in Congress, should confer impartial suffrage,
without distinction of color; and now I ask my
friend what inconsistency there is, when I insist upon
the same rule for Nebraska.</p>

<div class="medium">

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Wade.</span> I cannot see how the Senator could have
misled the Southern States with that. When they complied
with all we asked of them in the Constitutional Amendment,
I supposed we could not refuse to let them in on
those terms.… Certainly I am as much for colored suffrage
as any man on this floor; but when I make such an
agreement as that, I stand by it always.</p>

</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Sumner.</span> When I make an agreement, I stand
by it. But I entered into no such agreement, and I
do not understand that the Senate or Congress entered
into any such agreement. I know that certain politicians
and editors have undertaken to foist something
of this sort into the Constitutional Amendment; but
there was no authority for it. The Committee on Reconstruction
may have reported a resolution to that
effect, but they never called it up, and I know well
that I offered a resolution just the contrary.</p>

<div class="medium">

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Doolittle.</span> The Senator from Massachusetts will
allow me?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Sumner.</span> Certainly.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Doolittle.</span> The Committee on Reconstruction reported
a resolution, that, if each State should adopt this
Amendment, and the Amendment should become a part<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[Pg 134]</a></span>
of the Constitution, be adopted by a sufficient number of
States, then the States might be accepted. That was what
they reported.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Johnson.</span> It was a bill.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Wade.</span> That was the understanding I alluded to.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Brown.</span> That was not acted upon.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Sumner.</span> It was not acted on. I suppose that
those who had it in charge did not venture to invite a
vote upon it.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Doolittle.</span> It was laid on the table by a vote in
the House of Representatives, upon the yeas and nays.</p>

</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Sumner.</span> It never became in any respect a
legislative act; therefore nobody entered legislatively
into the agreement attributed to me. How the Senator
could attribute it to me, in the face of constant
asseveration that I would not be a party to any such
agreement, surpasses comprehension.</p>

<p class="center">…</p>

<p>So far as the Senator considered the merits of the
question, I will not now reply. There may be a time
for that, and the magnitude of the issue may justify
me even in setting forth arguments already adduced.
If I repeat myself, it is because you repeat an effort
which ought never to have been made. But I enter
my most earnest protest. To my mind this is a most
disastrous measure. I use this word advisedly; it is
disastrous because it cannot fail to impair the moral
efficiency of Congress, injure its influence, and be something
like a bar to the adoption of a just policy for the
Rebel States. Sir, we are now seeking to obliterate
the word “white” from all institutions and constitutions
there; and yet Senators, with that great question
before them, rush swiftly forward to welcome a new<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[Pg 135]</a></span>
State with the word “white” in its constitution. In
other days we all united, and the Senator from Ohio
was earnest among the number, in saying, “No more
Slave States!” I now insist upon another cry: “No
more States with the word ‘white’!” On that question
I part company with my friend from Ohio. He
is now about to welcome them.</p>

<div class="medium">

<p>The motion of Mr. Wade was adopted,&mdash;Yeas 21, Nays 11,&mdash;and
the bill was before the Senate for consideration. Mr. Gratz Brown
then offered the proviso, offered formerly by Mr. Sumner,<a name="FNanchor_47_47" id="FNanchor_47_47"></a><a href="#Footnote_47_47" class="fnanchor">[47]</a> requiring,
as a fundamental condition, that there should be no denial of the elective
franchise or of any other right on account of race or color, and
upon the further condition that this requirement be submitted to the
voters of the Territory. In the earnest debate that ensued, Mr. Sumner
spoke repeatedly, especially in reply to Mr. Wade, setting forth
again the objections already made to the admission of Colorado.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>December 19th, Mr. Sumner said:&mdash;</p>

</div>

<p>I have another word for the Senator from Ohio.
He does not see the importance of this question. It
is the question of every day, a commonplace question.
There is the precise difference between the Senator
from Ohio and other Senators. There have been
times when the Senator has most clearly seen the importance
of a question of Human Rights. The Senator
has not forgotten a contest in which he took part
with myself against an effort to precipitate Louisiana
back into this Chamber with a constitution like that
of Nebraska. Now the Senator remembers it well. The
Senator from Illinois [Mr. <span class="smcap">Trumbull</span>] tried to put that
constitution through the Senate; but, with all his abilities
and the just influence that belonged to his position,
he could not do it. The Senator from Ohio will not
be instructed by that example. He now makes a kindred<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[Pg 136]</a></span>
effort, seeking to introduce into the Union a State
which defies the first principle of Human Rights. The
Senator becomes the champion of that community. He
who has so often raised his voice for Human Rights
now treats the question as trivial: it is a technicality
only; that is all.</p>

<p>Sir, can a question of Human Rights be a technicality?
Can a constitution which undertakes to disfranchise
a whole race be treated in that effort as only
a technicality? And yet that is the position of the
Senator. Why, Sir, the other day he did openly arraign
the constitution of Louisiana, and the effort of our
excellent President, Abraham Lincoln, who pressed it
upon us. The constitution of Louisiana was odious;
it should not have been presented to the Senate; and
I doubt if there is any Senator on the right side who
does not now rejoice that it was defeated.</p>

<div class="medium">

<p>Then followed a passage with Mr. Kirkwood, of Iowa, who volunteered
to consider that Mr. Sumner had attacked the constitution of
Iowa, when he had made no allusion to it.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Kirkwood.</span> He compares the case of the Territory of Nebraska to
that of the lately rebellious States. I think there is a great difference between
them. The people of the Territory of Nebraska are loyal men; the
people of the late rebellious States are not loyal; and when he compares
the one with the other, I think he does injustice to himself and to the people
of that Territory.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Sumner.</span> I made no such comparison.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Kirkwood.</span> He speaks of the constitution submitted by some persons
in Louisiana as odious, as offensive, and compares the constitution of
Nebraska and the constitution of that State, or proposed State, intending to
convey the idea, I presume, that the constitution of Nebraska is odious and
offensive. Now I wish to say to that Senator that the constitution of Nebraska
and the constitution of Iowa in this particular are identical. Does
he call the constitution of Iowa odious and offensive?… The people of
Iowa are as loyal as the people of Massachusetts are.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Sumner.</span> No doubt about it. I never said otherwise.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Kirkwood.</span> But he said our constitution was offensive.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[Pg 137]</a></span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Sumner.</span> I made no allusion to the constitution of Iowa.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Kirkwood.</span> But you made an allusion to a constitution precisely
similar in this identical point to that of Iowa.… I repeat again, I cannot
see the difference between characterizing the constitution of Iowa as
odious and offensive and characterizing the constitution of another State
that agrees with it precisely in terms in that way.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Summer.</span> May I ask the Senator if he considers that provision in
the constitution of Iowa right or wrong?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Kirkwood.</span> I conceive it to be the business of the people of Iowa,
and not the business of the Senator from Massachusetts. The people of
Iowa will deal with it in their own way, when they see fit; and, as a loyal
people, they have the right to do so; and so, I apprehend, have the people
of Nebraska.</p>

</div>

</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Sumner.</span> The Senator from Iowa has not been
in this body very long. Had he been here longer, he
would have known that toward the people of Iowa, by
vote and voice, I have always been true. One of my
earliest efforts in this Chamber, now many years ago,
was in protection of the interests of the people of
Iowa. On that occasion, as the record shows, I received
from the Senators of Iowa expressions of friendship
and kindness which I cannot forget. I have
never thought of that State except with kindness and
respect. I have never alluded to that State except
with kindness and respect. I have made no allusion
to Iowa to-night. I have not had Iowa in my mind
to-night. And, Sir, for one good reason: it is my
habit, when I speak, so far as I am able, to speak
directly to the question. Iowa has not been before
us; her constitution has not been under discussion;
therefore I have had no occasion to express any opinion
upon it.</p>

<p>But there is another constitution which has been
before us, and on which I have been asked to vote.
On that constitution I express an opinion. I say it
contains an odious and offensive principle; and I doubt<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[Pg 138]</a></span>
if the Senator from Iowa would undertake to say that
an exclusion from rights on account of color would be
properly characterized otherwise than as odious and
offensive. I did not know that the constitution of
Iowa was open to that objection, or at least it was
not in my mind, when I spoke; but I do know that
the constitution of Nebraska is open to that objection,
and therefore I pronounce it odious and offensive. It
contains a disfranchisement of men on account of color,
and it is a little difficult to speak of that without losing
a little patience. It is difficult at this time, when
we have such great responsibilities with regard to the
States lately in rebellion, to look upon a candidate
State like that of Nebraska, coming forward with a
constitution containing this principle of disfranchisement,
without the strongest disposition to use language
which I do not want to use,&mdash;language of the utmost
condemnation. Such a constitution at this moment
from a new State does not deserve any quarter. Such
a constitution ought to be a hissing and a by-word;
and I am at a loss to understand how any Senator, at
this time, not entirely insensible to our great responsibilities
with regard to the States lately in rebellion,
can look upon a new constitution like this except as
a hissing and a by-word. Sir, it is a shame to the
people that bring it here; and it will be a shame to
Congress, if it gives it its sanction. I use that language
purposely, and I stand by it, even at the expense
of the criticism of the Senator from Iowa.</p>

<p>But, in saying this, I intend no reflection upon Iowa.
That State is not before us. Iowa is not a new State,
or Territory rather, applying for admission; nor is it,
thank God, a rebel State; but it is a true loyal State,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[Pg 139]</a></span>
which in other days, some years ago, in haste and under
sinister influence, introduced words into its constitution
which the Senator from that State now brings
forward in this Chamber, not for condemnation, but
from his tone I should suppose for praise. Sir, he
should rather follow another example, and throw a
cover over that part of the constitution of his State
which is unworthy the civilization of our times.</p>

<p>I am sorry to have been led into these remarks.
I was astonished that the Senator should compel me
to make them. When I go back to the earlier days,
I think that perhaps I might have expected other
things from a Senator of Iowa.</p>

<p>And now, Sir, I come again to the question which
in the opinion of the Senator from Ohio is so trivial,&mdash;nothing
more than a question of <i>assumpsit</i>.</p>

<div class="medium">

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Wade.</span> A common count in <i>assumpsit</i>.</p>

</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Sumner.</span> A common count.</p>

<p class="center">…</p>

<div class="medium">

<p>January 8th, after the holidays, the question was resumed, when
Mr. Sumner said:&mdash;</p>

</div>

<p class="center">…</p>

<p>But, Sir, the course of the Senate on this bill fills
me with anxiety. Since the unhappy perversity of the
President, nothing has occurred which seems to me of
such evil omen. It passes my comprehension how we
can require Equal Rights in the Rebel States, when we
deliberately sanction the denial of Equal Rights in a
new State, completely within our jurisdiction and about
to be fashioned by our hands. Others may commit this
inconsistency; I will not. Others may make the sacrifice;
I cannot.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[Pg 140]</a></span></p>

<p>It seems as if Providence presented this occasion
in order to give you an easy opportunity of asserting
a principle infinitely valuable to the whole country.
Only a few persons are directly interested; but the
decision of Congress now will determine a governing
rule for millions. Nebraska is a loyal community,
small in numbers, formed out of ourselves, bone of our
bone and flesh of our flesh. In an evil hour it adopted
a constitution bad in itself and worse still as an example.
But neither the tie of blood nor the fellowship
of party should be permitted to save it from judgment.
At this moment Congress cannot afford to sanction
such wrong. Congress must elevate itself, if it would
elevate the country. It must itself be the example of
justice, if it would make justice the universal rule. It
must itself be the model it recommends. It must begin
Reconstruction here at home.</p>

<p>With pain I differ from valued friends around me,
and see a line of duty which they do not see. Such
is my deference to them, that, if the question were
less clear or less important, I should abandon my own
conclusions and accept theirs. But when the question
is so plain and duty so imperative, I have no alternative.</p>

<p>Let me add, that, in taking the course I do, I have
nothing but friendly feelings for the Territory of Nebraska,
or for the men she has sent to represent her
in the Senate. I wish to see Nebraska populous and
flourishing, and the home of Human Rights secured
by irrevocable law; and as for her Senators, I know
them now so well that I shall have peculiar pleasure
in welcoming them on this floor. But there are voices
from Nebraska which I wish you to hear.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[Pg 141]</a></span></p>

<div class="medium">

<p>Here Mr. Sumner read letters against the admission of Nebraska
with her present constitution, and then proceeded.</p>

</div>

<p>In looking at this question, we are met at the threshold
by the fact that in a vote of nearly eight thousand
there was a majority of only one hundred in favor of
this disreputable constitution.<a name="FNanchor_48_48" id="FNanchor_48_48"></a><a href="#Footnote_48_48" class="fnanchor">[48]</a> At the call of less than
four thousand voters, you are to recognize a State
government which begins its independent life by defiance
of fundamental truths. I am at a loss to understand
the grounds on which this can be done, unless, in
anxiety to gratify the desires of a few persons and to
welcome the excellent gentlemen from Nebraska, you
are willing to set aside great principles of duty at a
critical moment of national history. It is pleasant to
be “amiable”; but you have no right to be amiable at
the expense of Human Rights. It is pleasant to be
“lenient,” as the Senator [Mr. <span class="smcap">Wade</span>] who is urging
this bill expresses it; but take care, that, in lenity to
this Territory, you are not unjust. There can be no
such thing as “lenity” where Human Rights are in
question.</p>

<p>The other Senator from Ohio [Mr. <span class="smcap">Sherman</span>] does
not leave room for discretion. He says we are bound
by the Enabling Act passed some time ago. Assume
that the Senator is right, and that the Enabling Act
creates an obligation on the part of Congress,&mdash;all of
which I deny,&mdash;I insist that there has been no compliance
with this Act, either in form or substance.</p>

<p>Looking at the Enabling Act, we find that it has not
been complied with in form. This can be placed beyond
question. By this Act it is provided that a “Convention<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[Pg 142]</a></span>”
of the people of Nebraska shall be chosen by
the people, that the election for such “Convention”
shall be held on “the first Monday in June thereafter,”
and that “the members of the Convention thus
elected shall meet at the capital of said Territory on
the first Monday in July next.” Now, in point of fact,
such Convention was duly chosen, and it met, according
to the provisions of the Enabling Act. Thus far all was
right. But, after meeting, it voluntarily adjourned or
dissolved, without framing a constitution. Afterward
the Territorial Legislature undertook to do what the
Convention failed to do. The Territorial Legislature
adopted a constitution, and submitted it to the people;
and this is the constitution before you. Plainly there
has been no compliance with the Enabling Act, so far
as it prescribes the proceedings for the formation of a
constitution. Nothing can be clearer than this. The
Act prescribes a Convention at a particular date. Instead
of a Convention at the date prescribed, we have
the Legislature acting at a different date; so that there
is an open non-compliance with the prescribed conditions.
It is vain, therefore, to adduce it. As well refer
to Homer’s Iliad or the Book of Job.</p>

<p>But the failure in substance is graver still. By the
Enabling Act it is further provided “that the constitution,
when formed, shall be republican, and not repugnant
to the Constitution of the United States and the
principles of the Declaration of Independence.” Here
are essential conditions which must be complied with.
The constitution must be “republican.” Now I insist
always that a constitution which denies Equality of
Rights cannot be republican. It may be republican
according to the imperfect notions of an earlier period,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[Pg 143]</a></span>
or even according to the standard of Montesquieu; but
it cannot be republican in a country which began its
national life in disregard of received notions and the
standards of the past. In fixing for the first time an
authoritative definition of this requirement, you cannot
forget the new vows to Human Rights uttered by our
fathers, nor can you forget that our republic is an example
to mankind. This is an occasion not to be lost
of acting not only for the present in time and place,
but for the distant also.</p>

<p>But there is another consideration, if possible, more
decisive. I say nothing now of the requirement that
the new constitution shall be “not repugnant to the
Constitution of the United States,” but I call attention
to the positive condition that it must be “not repugnant
to the principles of the Declaration of Independence.”
And yet, Sir, in the face of this plain requirement,
we have a new constitution which disfranchises
for color, and establishes what is compendiously called
“a white man’s government.” This new constitution
sets at nought the great principles that all men are
equal and that governments stand on the consent of
the governed. Therefore, I say confidently, it is not
according to “the principles of the Declaration of Independence.”
Is this doubted? Can it be doubted?
You must raze living words, you must kill undying
truths, before you can announce any such conformity.
As long as those words exist, as long as those truths
shine forth in that Declaration, you must condemn this
new constitution. I remember gratefully the electric
power with which the Senator from Ohio [Mr. <span class="smcap">Wade</span>],
not many years ago, confronting the representatives of
Slavery, bravely vindicated these principles as “self-evident<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[Pg 144]</a></span>
truths.” “There was a Brutus once that would
have brooked the eternal Devil” as easily as any denial
of these. Would that he would speak now as then, and
insist on their practical application everywhere within
the power of Congress, and thus set up a wall of defence
for the downtrodden!</p>

<p>Thus the question stands. The Enabling Act has not
been complied with in any respect, whether of form or
substance. In form it has been openly disregarded; in
substance it has been insulted. The failure in form
may be pardoned; the failure in substance must be
fatal, unless in some way corrected by Congress.</p>

<p>Nobody doubts that Congress, in providing for the
formation of a State constitution, may affix conditions.
This has been done from the beginning of our history.
Search the Enabling Acts, and you will find these conditions.
They are in your statute-book, constant witnesses
to the power of Congress, unquestioned and unquestionable.</p>

<p>Thus, for instance, the Enabling Act for Nebraska
requires three things of the new State as conditions
precedent.</p>

<p><i>First.</i> That Slavery shall be forever prohibited.</p>

<p><i>Secondly.</i> That no inhabitant shall be molested in
person or property on account of religious worship.</p>

<p><i>Thirdly.</i> That the unappropriated public lands shall
remain at the sole disposition of the United States,
without being subject to local taxation, and that land
of non-residents shall never be taxed higher than that
of residents.</p>

<p>Read the Act, and you will find these conditions.
Does any Senator doubt their validity? Impossible.</p>

<p>But this is not all. In addition to these three conditions<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[Pg 145]</a></span>
are three others, which in order, if not in importance,
stand even before these. They are contained in
words already quoted, but strangely forgotten in this
debate:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“That the constitution, when formed, shall be republican,
and not repugnant to the Constitution of the United States
and the principles of the Declaration of Independence.”</p>

</div>

<p>Consider this clause: you will find it contains three
conditions, each of vital force.</p>

<p><i>First.</i> The constitution must be “republican.” It
does not say “in form” merely, but “republican”:
of course “republican” in substance and reality.</p>

<p><i>Secondly.</i> The constitution must be “not repugnant
to the Constitution of the United States.” But surely
any constitution which contains a discrimination of
rights on account of color must be “repugnant” to the
Constitution of the United States, which contains no
such discrimination. The text of the National Constitution
is blameless; but the text of this new constitution
is offensive. Hence its repugnancy.</p>

<p><i>Thirdly.</i> The constitution must be “not repugnant
to the principles of the Declaration of Independence.”
These plain words allow no equivocation. Solemnly
you have required this just and noble conformity. But
is it not an insult to the understanding, when you offer
a constitution which contains a discrimination of rights
on account of color?</p>

<p>Now in all these three requirements, so authoritatively
made the conditions of the new constitution,
Nebraska fails, wretchedly fails. It is vain to say
that the people there were not warned. They were
warned. These requirements were in the very title-deed

<p>Mr. President, pardon me, I entreat you, if I am tenacious.
At this moment there is one vast question in
our country, on which all others pivot. It is justice
to the colored race. Without this I see small chance
of security, tranquillity, or even of peace. The war will
still continue. Therefore, as a servant of truth and a
lover of my country, I cannot allow this cause to be
sacrificed or discredited by my vote. Others will do
as they please; but, if I stand alone, I will hold this
bridge.</p>

<div class="medium">

<p>The persistence of Mr. Sumner was encountered by Mr. Wade, who
said:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“I think it is the business of the statesman to overlook these little small
technicalities which gentlemen argue about in this body. They make a
great fuss about the word ‘white’ in a constitution of a State where there
are no blacks,&mdash;where the question is a simple abstraction.”</p>

</div>

<p>Mr. Cowan, of Pennsylvania, dealt with the question of Equality,
but with pleasantry.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“My honorable friend, the Senator from Massachusetts, is six feet three
inches in height, and weighs two hundred and twenty pounds; I am six
feet three inches in height, and weigh one hundred and ninety pounds, if
you please. That is not equality. My honorable friend from Maine here
is five feet nine inches”&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Fessenden.</span> And a half. [<i>Laughter.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Cowan.</span> I beg the honorable Senator’s pardon. I would not diminish
his stature an inch or half an inch, nor take a hair from his head; and
he weighs one hundred and forty pounds, if you please. Is that equality?
The honorable Senator from Massachusetts is largely learned; he has traversed
the whole field of human learning; there is nothing, I think, that he
does not know, that is worth knowing,&mdash;and this is no empty compliment
that I desire to pay him now; and he is so much wiser than I am, that
at the last elections he divined exactly how they would result, and I did
not. [<i>Laughter.</i>] He rode triumphantly upon the popular wave; and I
was overwhelmed, and came out with eyes and nose suffused, and hardly
able to gasp.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Sumner.</span> You ought to have followed my counsel.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Cowan.</span> Why should I not? What was Providence doing in that?
If Providence had made me equal to the honorable Senator, I should not
have needed his counsel, and I should have ridden, too, on the topmost
wave. [<i>Laughter.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[Pg 147]</a></span></p>
<p>January 9th, the amendment of Mr. Gratz Brown was rejected,&mdash;Yeas
8, Nays 24. The Senators voting in the affirmative were Mr.
Cowan, of Pennsylvania, Mr. Edmunds, of Vermont, Mr. Fessenden,
of Maine, Mr. Grimes, of Iowa, Mr. Howe, of Wisconsin, Mr. Morgan,
of New York, Mr. Poland, of Vermont, and Mr. Sumner.</p>

<p>Mr. Edmunds then moved the following amendment:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“That this act shall take effect with the fundamental and perpetual condition
that within said State of Nebraska there shall be no abridgment or
denial of the exercise of the elective franchise or of any other right to any
person by reason of race or color, excepting Indians not taxed.”</p>

</div>

<p>It will be observed that this differs from Mr. Sumner’s in not requiring
the submission of the fundamental condition to the voters
of the Territory. This amendment was lost by a tie-vote,&mdash;Yeas 18,
Nays 18. At the next stage of the bill, being again moved by Mr.
Edmunds, it was adopted,&mdash;Yeas 20, Nays 18. The bill was then
passed by the Senate,&mdash;Yeas 24, Nays 15.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>In the other House, the proviso adopted by the Senate was changed,
on motion of Mr. Boutwell, of Massachusetts, so as to require that the
Legislature of the State should by a solemn public act declare consent
to the fundamental condition, and the bill was then passed,&mdash;Yeas
103, Nays 55. In this amendment the Senate concurred.</p>

<p>February 8th, the bill was again passed in the Senate, by a two-thirds
vote, over the veto of the President,&mdash;Yeas 31, Nays 9; and
February 9th, in the other House, by a two-thirds vote,&mdash;Yeas 120,
Nays 44. And so the bill became a law.<a name="FNanchor_49_49" id="FNanchor_49_49"></a><a href="#Footnote_49_49" class="fnanchor">[49]</a> Colorado was less fortunate.<a name="FNanchor_50_50" id="FNanchor_50_50"></a><a href="#Footnote_50_50" class="fnanchor">[50]</a></p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Thus the protracted struggle for Equal Rights in Nebraska, establishing
a fundamental condition, was crowned with success, preparing
the way for similar requirement in the Rebel States.</p>

<p class="dropcap">MR. PRESIDENT,&mdash;At another time I might be
induced to go into this question at some length;
but now, in these latter days of a weary session, and
under these heats, I feel that I must be brief. And
yet I could not pardon myself, if I did not undertake,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[Pg 149]</a></span>
even at this time, to present a plain and simple account
of the great change which is now proposed.</p>

<p>There is something captivating in the idea of weights
and measures common to all the civilized world, so
that, in this at least, the confusion of Babel may be
overcome. Kindred is that other idea of one money;
and both are forerunners, perhaps, of the grander idea
of one language for all the civilized world. Philosophy
does not despair of this triumph at some distant day;
but a common system of weights and measures and a
common system of money are already within the sphere
of actual legislation. The work has already begun; and
it cannot cease until the great object is accomplished.</p>

<p>If the United States come tardily into the circle of
nations recognizing a common system of weights and
measures, I confess that I have pleasure in recalling
the historic fact that at a very early day this important
subject was commended to Congress. Washington,
in a speech to the First Congress, touched the
key-note, when he used the word “uniformity” in connection
with this subject. “Uniformity,” he said, “in
the currency, weights, and measures of the United
States is an object of great importance, and will, I am
persuaded, be duly attended to.”<a name="FNanchor_51_51" id="FNanchor_51_51"></a><a href="#Footnote_51_51" class="fnanchor">[51]</a> Then again in a
speech to the next Congress he went further, in expressing
a desire for “a standard at once <em>invariable and
universal</em>.”<a name="FNanchor_52_52" id="FNanchor_52_52"></a><a href="#Footnote_52_52" class="fnanchor">[52]</a> Here he foreshadowed a system common
to the civilized world. It is for us now to recognize
the standard he thus sententiously described. All hail
to a standard “invariable and universal”!</p>

<p>I shall not occupy time in developing the history<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[Pg 150]</a></span>
of these efforts on the part of our Government; but
I cannot forbear mentioning that Mr. Jefferson, while
Secretary of State, made an elaborate report, where he
proposed “reducing every branch to the same decimal
ratio already established in the coins, and thus bringing
the calculation of the principal affairs of life within the
arithmetic of every man who can multiply and divide
plain numbers.”<a name="FNanchor_53_53" id="FNanchor_53_53"></a><a href="#Footnote_53_53" class="fnanchor">[53]</a> Here is an essential element in the
common system we seek to establish. This was in
1790, when France was just beginning those efforts
which ended at last in the establishment of the metric
system. The subject was revived at different times in
Congress without definite result. President Madison,
in his annual message of 1816, called attention to it
in the following words:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“The great utility of a standard <em>fixed in its nature and
founded on the easy rule of decimal proportions</em> is sufficiently
obvious. It led the Government at an early stage to preparatory
steps for introducing it; and a completion of the
work will be a just title to the public gratitude.”<a name="FNanchor_54_54" id="FNanchor_54_54"></a><a href="#Footnote_54_54" class="fnanchor">[54]</a></p>

</div>

<p>Out of this recommendation originated that call of
the Senate which drew forth the masterly report of
John Quincy Adams on the whole subject of weights
and measures, where learning, philosophy, and prophetic
aspiration vie with each other. After reviewing
whatever had appeared in the past, and subjecting
it all to careful examination, he says of the French
metric system, then only an experiment:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“This system approaches to the ideal perfection of uniformity
applied to weights and measures, and, whether destined<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[Pg 151]</a></span>
to succeed or doomed to fail, will shed unfading glory
upon the age in which it was conceived and upon the nation
by which its execution was attempted and has been in part
achieved.”<a name="FNanchor_55_55" id="FNanchor_55_55"></a><a href="#Footnote_55_55" class="fnanchor">[55]</a></p>

</div>

<p>This was in 1821, when the metric system, already
invented, was still struggling for adoption in France.</p>

<p>This brief sketch shows how from the beginning the
National Government has been looking to a system
common to the civilized world. And now this aspiration
seems about to be fulfilled. The bills before you
have already passed the other House; if they become
laws, as I trust, they will be the practical commencement
of the “new order.”</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Before proceeding to explain the proposed system,
let me exhibit for one moment the necessity of change,
as illustrated by weights and measures in the past.</p>

<p>Language is coeval with man as a social being.
Weights and measures are hardly less early in origin.
They are essential to the operations of society, and
are naturally common to all who belong to the same
social circle. At the beginning, each people had a
system of its own; but as nations gradually intermingle
and distant places are brought together by the
attractions of commerce, the system of one nation becomes
inadequate to the necessities of the composite
body. A common system becomes important just in
proportion to the community of interests. Next to
diversity of languages, discordant weights and measures
attest the insulation of nations.</p>

<p>The earliest measures were derived from the several
parts of the human body. Such was the cubit, which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[Pg 152]</a></span>
was the distance between the elbow and the end of the
middle finger, being about twenty-two inches. Such
also were the foot, the hand, the span, the nail, and the
thumb. These measures were derived from Nature, and
they were to be found wherever a human being existed.
But they partook of the uncertainty in the proportions
of the human form. When Selden, in his “Table-Talk,”
wittily likened Equity, so far as it depended on the
Chancellor, to a measure determined by the length of
the Chancellor’s foot, he exposed not only the uncertainty
of Equity, but also the uncertainty of such a
measure.</p>

<p>Even in Greece, where Art prevailed in the most
beautiful forms, the famous <i>stadium</i> was none the less
uncertain. It was the distance that Hercules could
run without taking breath, being six hundred times the
length of his foot.</p>

<p>Our own standards, derived from England, are of
an equally fanciful character. The unit of <i>length</i> is
the barley-corn, taken from the middle of the ear and
well dried. Three of these in a straight line make
an inch. The unit of <i>weight</i> is a grain of wheat, taken,
like the barley-corn, from the middle of the ear and
well dried. Of these, twenty-four are equal to a pennyweight.
Twenty pennyweights make an ounce, and
twelve ounces make a pound. The unit of <i>capacity</i> is
derived from the weight of grains of wheat. Eight
pounds of these make one gallon of wine measure.</p>

<p>Nor are the extreme vagueness and instability of
these standards the only surprise. There is no principle
of science or convenience in the progression of
the different series. Thus we have two pints to a
quart, three scruples to a dram, four quarts to a gallon,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[Pg 153]</a></span>
five quarters to an ell, five and a half yards to a perch,
six feet to a fathom, eight furlongs to a mile, twelve
inches to a foot, sixteen ounces to a pound, twenty
units to a score.</p>

<p>Then, as if the only ruling principle governing the
selection were discord, we have different measures bearing
the same name, such as the wine pint and the
dry pint, the ounce Troy and the ounce avoirdupois.
Take these last two measures as illustrating the prevailing
confusion. Both seem to come from France.
The Troy weight is supposed to derive its name from
the French town of Troyes, where a celebrated fair
was once held. The term “avoirdupois” is French,
and seems to have been part of a statute which declared
how weights should be determined. But Troy
and avoirdupois are different measures.</p>

<p>These measures, having constant differences, had accidental
differences also, in different parts of England,
and also in different parts of our own country. Even
where the names are alike, the measures are often unlike.
In England the diversity was almost infinite, so
that these same measures differed in different counties,
and sometimes in different towns of the same
county. Latterly in the United States the standard
has been regulated by law, but the confusion from the
measures still continues. The question naturally arises,
why such confusion has been allowed so long without
correction. The answer is easy. Except in rare instances,
the triumphs of science are slow and gradual.
Traditional prejudice must be overcome. Each nation
is attached to its own imperfect system, as to its own
language. Even though inferior to another, it has the
great advantage of being known to the people that use<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[Pg 154]</a></span>
it. To this constant impediment it is proper to add
the intrinsic difficulty of establishing a uniform system
of weights and measures which shall satisfy the demands
of civilization in scientific precision, in immediate
practical applicability, and in nomenclature.</p>

<p>Take, for instance, the application of the decimal
system, which seems at first sight simple and complete.
It is unquestionably an immense improvement
on the old confusion; but even here we encounter a
difficulty in the circumstance, long since recognized by
mathematicians, that our scale of decimal arithmetic is
more the child of chance than of philosophy. I know
not if any better reason can be given for its adoption
than because man has everywhere reckoned by his ten
fingers. On this account it is often called “natural.”
But, considering whether the number <em>ten</em> possesses any
intrinsic excellence, convenience, or fitness, as a ratio
of progression, good authorities have answered in the
negative. It is the duplication of an odd number,
which can furnish neither a square nor a cube, and
which cannot be halved without departure from the
decimal scale. In this scale we seem to see always
those early days when “wild in woods the noble savage
ran,” and for arithmetic used fingers or toes. An
<em>octaval</em> system, founded on the number eight, would
have been better adapted to the divisions of material
things. Among us the decimal system is adopted for
money; but you all know that we are not able to carry
it into rigid practice. Thus convenience, if not necessity,
requires the half-dollar, the quarter-dollar, the half-dime,
and the three-cent piece. In fact, eight divisions
to the dollar, as prevailed in Spain, are more available
in the business of life than the decimal division. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[Pg 155]</a></span>
number <em>eight</em> is capable of indefinite bisection. The
progression beginning with two would proceed to four,
eight, sixteen, thirty-two, sixty-four, and so on.</p>

<p>The decimal scale is made easy of use by the happy
system of notation borrowed from the Hindoos, which
might be applied equally well to an octaval scale; but
at this time it would be vain to propose a change in
the radix of the numerical scale. The number <em>ten</em> is
the recognized starting-point, and gives its name to the
scale. It only remains for us at present to follow other
nations in applying it to an improved system of weights
and measures.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>A system of weights and measures born of philosophy,
rather than of chance, is what we now seek. To
this end old systems must be abandoned. A chance
system cannot be universal: science is universal; therefore
what is produced by science may find a home
everywhere. If we consider the proper elements or
characteristics of such a system, we find at least three
essential conditions. First, the new system must have
in itself the assurance of unvarying stability, and, to
this end, it should be derived from some standard in
Nature by which to correct errors creeping into the
weights and measures from time or imperfect manufacture.
Secondly, the parts should be divided decimally,
as nearly as practice will warrant, in conformity
with our arithmetic. Thirdly, it should be such as to
disturb national prejudices as little as possible.</p>

<p>To a common observer the difficulties of finding an
unvarying standard are not readily apparent. But philosophy
shows that all things in Nature are undergoing
change; so that there would seem to be no invariable<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[Pg 156]</a></span>
magnitude, the same in all countries and in all times,
as Cicero pictured the great principles of Natural
Law,<a name="FNanchor_56_56" id="FNanchor_56_56"></a><a href="#Footnote_56_56" class="fnanchor">[56]</a> by which a lost standard on an inaccessible
island might be reproduced with mathematical certainty.
There is but one magnitude in Nature which,
so far as we know, approximates to these requisites.
I refer to the length of the pendulum vibrating seconds,
which in our latitude is about 39.1 inches. This
length, however, varies in travelling from the equator
to the pole, and it also varies slightly under different
meridians and the same latitude; but the law of variation
has been determined with considerable accuracy.
One element in this variation is the difference of temperature.
In his report on weights and measures, Mr.
Jefferson proposed that we should find our standard in
the pendulum. At the same time, the French Government,
just struggling to throw off ancestral institutions,
conceived the idea of a new system, which, founded in
science, should be common to the civilized world.</p>

<p>The French began not only by discarding old systems,
but also by discarding a measure derived from
the pendulum. They conceived the idea of measuring
an arc of the earth’s meridian, and finding a new unit
in a subdivision of this immense span. The work was
undertaken. An arc of the meridian, embracing upward
of nine degrees of latitude, and extending from
Dunkirk, in France, to the Mediterranean, near Barcelona,
in Spain, was measured with scientific care. Illustrious
names in French science, Méchain and Delambre,
were engaged in the work, which proceeded, notwithstanding
domestic convulsion and foreign war. The
Reign of Terror at home and invasion from abroad did<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[Pg 157]</a></span>
not arrest it. Seven years elapsed before the measurements
were completed, when other nations were invited
to coöperate in the establishment of the new system.</p>

<p>The unit of measure was one ten-millionth part of
the distance between the equator and the north pole
thus measured. It received the name of <i>metre</i>, from
the Greek, signifying <i>measure</i>. A bar of platinum,
representing this length, was prepared with all possible
accuracy. This bar was deposited in the archives
of France as the perpetual standard. Other bars have
been copied from it and distributed throughout France
and in foreign countries.</p>

<p>There is something transcendental in the idea of this
measurement of the earth in order to find a measure for
daily life. It was an immense undertaking. But the
conception seems to have been vast rather than practical.
There is reason to believe, from later labors, that
there was a serious error in the work. Thus, the distance
of 10,000,000 metres from the equator to the
north pole, established by the French observers, is too
small by 935 yards, according to Bessel,&mdash;by 1,410
yards, according to Puissant,&mdash;and by 1,967 yards,
according to Chazallon. Sir John Herschell also testifies
with the authority of his great name against the
accuracy of this result. If there be an error such as
is supposed, then the metre ceases to be what it was
called originally, one ten-millionth part of the distance
from the equator to the north pole.</p>

<p>Even assuming that there is no error, and that the
metre is precisely what it purports to be, yet it is not
easy to see how the artificial standard can be corrected
by recurrence to the standard in Nature. The massive
work originally undertaken will not be repeated. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[Pg 158]</a></span>
astronomers of France will not verify the accuracy of
the bar of platinum, which is the artificial standard, by
another scientific enterprise, requiring years for completion.
Therefore, for all practical purposes, the metre
is really nothing else than a bar of platinum with a
certain length preserved in the archives of France. It
is not less arbitrary as a standard than the yard or
foot, and it can be perpetuated in practice only by distribution
of exact copies from the original bar, which
is the assumed metre.</p>

<p>I have thus explained the origin and character of
the metre, because I desire that the admirable system
founded on it should be seen actually as it is. To
my mind, it gains nothing from the theory which presided
at its origin. Its unit is not to be regarded as
a certain portion of the distance between the equator
and the north pole, but as an artificial measure determined
with peculiar care. Had the same or any other
unit been selected without measurement of the earth,
the metric system would not have been less beautiful
or perfect.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Look now at the system. The metre, which is assumed
to be one ten-millionth part of the distance
from the equator to the pole, is, in fact, 39⅓ inches,
or 39.37 inches, in length. It is especially the unit
of <i>length</i>; but it is also the unit from which are derived
all measures of weight and capacity, square or cubic.
It is at once foundation-stone and cap-stone. It is
foundation-stone to all in the ascending series, and
cap-stone to all in the descending series.</p>

<p>The unit of <i>surface measure</i>, or land measure, is the
<i>are</i>, from the Latin <i>area</i>, and is the square of ten metres,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[Pg 159]</a></span>
or, in other words, a square of which each side is
ten metres in length.</p>

<p>The unit of <i>solid measure</i> is the <i>stere</i>, from the Greek,
and is the cube of a metre, or, in other words, a solid
mass one metre long, one metre broad, and one metre
high.</p>

<p>The unit of <i>liquid measure</i> is the <i>litre</i>, from the
Greek, and is the cube of the tenth part of the metre,
which is the <i>decimetre</i>; or, in other words, it is
a vessel where by interior measurement each side and
the bottom are square <i>decimetres</i>.</p>

<p>The unit of <i>weight</i> is the <i>gram</i>, also derived from the
Greek, and is the one-thousandth part of the weight of
a cubic litre of distilled water at its greatest density,&mdash;this
being just above the freezing-point.</p>

<p>Such are main elements of the metric system. But
each of these has multiples and subdivisions. It is
multiplied decimally upward, and divided decimally
downward. The multiples are from the Greek. Thus,
<i>deca</i>, ten, <i>hecto</i>, hundred, <i>kilo</i>, thousand, and <i>myria</i>, ten
thousand, prefixed to <i>metre</i>, signify ten metres, one
hundred metres, one thousand metres, and ten thousand
metres. The subdivisions are from the Latin. Thus,
<i>deci</i>, <i>centi</i>, <i>milli</i>, prefixed to <i>metre</i>, signify one tenth,
one hundredth, and one thousandth of a metre. All
this appears in the following table.</p>

<p>These same prefixes may be applied in ascending and
descending scales to the are, the litre, and the gram.
Thus, for example, we have in the ascending scale, <i>deca</i>gram,
<i>hecto</i>gram, <i>kilo</i>gram, and <i>myria</i>gram,&mdash;and in the
descending scale, <i>deci</i>gram, <i>centi</i>gram, <i>milli</i>gram.</p>

<p>In this brief space you behold the whole metric system
of weights and measures. What a contrast to the
anterior confusion! A boy at school can master the
metric system in an afternoon. Months, if not years,
are required to store away the perplexities, incongruities,
and inconsistencies of the existing weights and
measures, and then memory must often fail in reproducing
them. The mystery of compound arithmetic
is essential in the calculations they require. All this
is done away by the decimal progression, so that the
first four rules of arithmetic are ample for the pupil.</p>

<p>Looking closely at the metric system, we must confess
its simplicity and symmetry. Like every creation
of science, it is according to rule. Master the rule and
you master the system. On this account it may be
acquired by the young with comparative facility, and,
when once acquired, it may be used with despatch.
Thus it becomes labor-saving and time-saving. Among
its merits I cannot hesitate to mention the nomenclature.
A superficial criticism has objected to the Greek
and Latin prefixes; but this forgets that a system intended
for universal adoption must discard all local
or national terms. The prefixes employed are equally
intelligible in all countries. They are no more French
than English or German. They are common, or cosmopolitan,
and in all countries they are equally suggestive
in disclosing the denomination of the measure.
They combine the peculiar advantages of a universal<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[Pg 161]</a></span>
name and a definition. The name instantly suggests
the measure with exquisite precision. If these words
seem scholastic or pedantic, you must bear this for the
sake of their universality and defining power.</p>

<p>Unquestionably it is difficult for one generation to
substitute a new system for that learned in childhood.
Even in France the metric system was tardily adopted.
Napoleon himself, on one occasion, said impatiently to
an engineer who answered his inquiry in metres, “What
are metres? Tell me in <i>toises</i>.” It was only in 1840
that the system was definitely required in the transaction
of business. Since then it has been the legal
system of France. Cloth is sold by the metre; roads
are measured by the kilometre; meat is sold by the
kilogram, or, as it is familiarly abridged, by so many
<i>kilos</i>.</p>

<p>It is generally admitted that the names are too long,
although nobody has been able to suggest substitutes,
unless we regard the various abridgments in that light.
But no abridgment should be allowed to sacrifice the
cosmopolitan character which belongs to the system.
Thus, in England a nomenclature is proposed which
would secure short names; but these would be different
in each language, and entirely different from the
French names. This is a mistake. The names in all
languages should be identical, or so nearly alike as to
be recognized at once. This may be accomplished by
an abbreviated nomenclature.</p>

<p>For instance, we may say <i>met</i>, <i>ar</i>, <i>lit</i>, and <i>gram</i>;
and, in describing the denomination, we may say, in
the ascending scale, <i>dec</i>, <i>hec</i>, <i>kil</i>, and in the descending
scale, <i>dec</i>, <i>cen</i>, and <i>mil</i>,&mdash;indicating respectively 10, 100,
1000, and ⅒, ¹⁄₁₀₀ and ¹⁄₁₀₀₀. Compounding these, we<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[Pg 162]</a></span>
should have, for example, <i>kilmet</i>, <i>killit</i>, <i>kilgram</i>, and
<i>cenmet</i>, <i>cenlit</i>, <i>cengram</i>. These abbreviations might be
substantially the same in all languages. They would
preserve the characteristics of the unabridged terms, so
that the simple mention of the measure, even in this
abridged form, would disclose the proportion it bears
to its fellow-measures. Previous measures have been
represented by monosyllables, as grain, dram, gross,
ounce, pound, stone, ton. Where a word is often repeated,
in the hurry of business, it is instinctively
abridged. We shall not err, if we profit by this experience,
and seek to reduce the new nomenclature to
its smallest proportions.</p>

<p>Twelve words only are required by this system.
Learning these, you learn all. There are five designating
the different units of length, surface, solid
capacity, liquid capacity, and weight. Then there are
the seven prefixes, being four in the ascending scale,
expressing <em>multiples</em>, or augmentations, of the metre
or other units, derived from the Greek, and three in
the descending scale, expressing subdivisions, or diminutions,
of the metre and other units, derived from
the Latin. These twelve words contain the whole
system.</p>

<p>In closing this chapter on the unquestionable advantages
of the metric system, I must not forget that
it is already the received system in the majority of
countries. At the Statistical Congress assembled at
Berlin in 1863, it appeared that it was adopted partly
or entirely in Austria, Baden, Bavaria, Belgium, France,
Hamburg, Hanover, Hesse, Mecklenburg, the Netherlands,
Parma, Portugal, Sardinia, Saxony, Spain, Switzerland,
Tuscany, the Two Sicilies, and Würtemberg.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[Pg 163]</a></span>
Since then, Great Britain, by an Act of Parliament, has
added her name to this list. The first step is taken
there by making the metric system <em>permissive</em>, as is
proposed in the bills before Congress. The example
of Great Britain is of especial importance to us, since
the commercial relations between the two countries
render it essential that these should have a common
system of weights and measures. On this point we
cannot afford to differ from each other.</p>

<p>The adoption of the metric system by the United
States will go far to complete the circle by which this
great improvement will be assured to mankind. Here
is a new agent of civilization, to be felt in all the concerns
of life, at home and abroad. It will be hardly
less important than the Arabic numerals, by which the
operations of arithmetic are rendered common to all
nations. It will help undo the primeval confusion of
which the Tower of Babel was the representative.</p>

<p>As the first practical step to this great end, I ask
the Senate to sanction the bills which have already
passed the other House, and which I have reported
from the special committee on the metric system. By
these enactments the metric system will be presented
to the American people, and will become an approved
instrument of commerce. It will not be forced into
use, but will be left for the present to its own intrinsic
merits. Meanwhile it must be taught in schools. Our
arithmetics must explain it. They who have already
passed a certain period of life may not adopt it; but
the rising generation will embrace it, and ever afterwards
number it among the choicest possessions of an
advanced civilization.</p>

<p class="plabeln"><span class="smcap">Speech in the Senate, on a Joint Resolution authorizing a
Contract with Vinnie Ream for a Statue of Abraham Lincoln,
July 27, 1866.</span></p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/line.png" width="80" height="16" alt="" />
</div>

<div class="medium">

<p>July 27th, on the last evening of the session, while the galleries
were thronged, Mr. Conness, of California, called for the consideration
of the joint resolution, which had already passed the House
of Representatives, “authorizing a contract with Vinnie Ream for
a statue of Abraham Lincoln.” The following incident then occurred.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Sumner.</span> Before that is taken up, I wish, with the consent of the
Senator, that I might be allowed to put a joint resolution on its passage.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Conness.</span> This will only occupy a moment.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Sumner.</span> It will be debated.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Conness.</span> Not, if you do not debate it.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Sumner.</span> It must be debated.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Conness.</span> Will you debate it?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Sumner.</span> I shall debate it.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Conness.</span> Let the Senator debate it now. I shall not give way,
in that case.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Sumner.</span> I merely wish to put a joint resolution upon its passage
that will take no time.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Conness.</span> That is asking too much.</p>

</div>

<p>Mr. Chandler, of Michigan, then asked Mr. Conness “to give way
for a moment” to allow him to call up&mdash;&mdash;Here he was arrested
by the answer, “I cannot give way to the Senator, after having
refused another Senator.” The joint resolution was then read:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“<i>Resolved, &amp;c.</i>, That the Secretary of the Interior be, and he hereby is,
authorized and directed to contract with Miss Vinnie Ream for a life-size<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[Pg 165]</a></span>
model and statue of the late President Abraham Lincoln, to be executed
by her, at a price not exceeding $10,000, one half payable on completion
of the model in plaster, and the remaining half on completion of the statue
in marble to his acceptance.”</p>

</div>

<p>Mr. Lane, of Indiana, then moved to proceed with the pension
bills that had already passed the other House, and this motion,
after debate, prevailed,&mdash;Yeas 19, Nays 18. The pension bills and
other bills were then considered, when another effort was made for
the joint resolution.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Wade.</span> I move to take up the joint resolution authorizing a contract
with Vinnie Ream for a statue of Abraham Lincoln.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Sumner.</span> I hope that will not be taken up.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Several Senators.</span> Oh, let us vote.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Sumner.</span> Senators say, “Oh, let us vote.” The question is about
giving away $10,000.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Conness.</span> Taking it up is not giving money away, I hope.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Sumner.</span> The question is, I say, about giving away $10,000:
that is the proposition involved in this joint resolution.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Conness.</span> For a statue.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Sumner.</span> The Senator says, “For a statue”: an impossible statue,
I say,&mdash;one which cannot be made. However, I say nothing on the merits
now; that will come at another time, if the resolution is taken up. I ask
for the yeas and nays on the question of taking up.</p>

</div>

<p>The question, being taken by yeas and nays, resulted, Yeas 26,
Nays 8. So the motion was agreed to, and the Senate, as in committee
of the whole, resumed the consideration of the joint resolution.
Mr. Sumner said:&mdash;</p>

</div>

<p class="dropcap">Some evenings ago, Sir, I attempted to secure an
appropriation of $10,000 for worthy public servants
in one of the Departments of the Government.
In presenting that case, it was my duty to exhibit
something of their necessities. I showed you how the
money was needed by them to meet the expenses of
living, which, as we all know, are constantly increasing,
while the value of money is decreasing. I showed
you also that they were entitled to this allowance by the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[Pg 166]</a></span>
service they had performed. After ample discussion,
extended through several evenings, the Senate refused
outright to appropriate $10,000 for distribution among
public servants who, I insisted, had earned it by faithful
labor. You acted on a sentiment of economy. It
was urged, that, considering the numerous and heavy
draughts upon the Treasury, we should not be justified
in such allowance, and that, if it were made,
then we should be obliged to make it in other cases,
and there would be no end to the drain upon the
Treasury. You all remember the fever of economy
that broke out, and also the result. The proposition
was voted down.</p>

<p>Now, Sir, a proposition is brought forward to appropriate
that identical sum of $10,000 for a work of
art. I speak of it in the most general way. If there
were any assurance that the work in question could be
worthy of so large a sum, if there were any reason
to imagine that the favorite who is to be the beneficiary
under this resolution were really competent to
execute such a work, still, at this time and under the
circumstances by which we are surrounded, I might
well object to its passage, simply on reasons of economy.
This argument is not out of place. I present,
then, as my first objection, the consideration of economy.
Do not, Sir, wastefully, inconsiderately, heedlessly
give away so much. If you are in the mood
of appropriation on this scale, select some of those
public servants who have been discharging laborious
duties on an inadequate compensation, and bestow it
upon them. Be just before you are generous. Do
this rather than become such sudden patrons of art.
I hope that I do not treat the question too gravely.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[Pg 167]</a></span>
You treated the motion to augment compensation in
the State Department very gravely. I but follow your
example.</p>

<p>But, Sir, there is another aspect to which I allude,
with your pardon. I enter upon it with great reluctance.
I am unwilling to utter a word that would
bear hard upon any one, least of all upon a youthful
artist, where sex imposes reserve, if not on her part,
at least on mine; but when a proposition like this is
brought forward, I am bound to meet it frankly.</p>

<p>Each Senator will act on his own judgment and the
evidence before him. Each will be responsible to his
own conscience for the vote he gives. Now, Sir, with
the little knowledge I have of such things, with the
small opportunities I have enjoyed of observing works
of art, and with the moderate acquaintance I have
formed among artists, I am bound to express a confident
opinion that this candidate is not competent to
produce the work you propose to order. You might as
well place her on the staff of General Grant, or, putting
him aside, place her on horseback in his stead.
She cannot do it. She might as well contract to furnish
an epic poem, or the draft of a bankrupt bill. I
am pained to be constrained into these remarks; but,
when you press a vote, you leave me no alternative.
Admit that she may make a statue; she cannot make
one that you will be justified in placing here. Promise
is not performance; but what she has done thus
far comes under the former head rather than the latter.
Surely this National Capitol, so beautiful and interesting,
and already historic, should not be opened to
the rude experiment of untried talent. Only the finished
artist should be admitted here.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[Pg 168]</a></span></p>

<p>Sir, I doubt if you consider enough the character of
the edifice in which we are assembled. Possessing the
advantage of an incomparable situation, it is among
the first-class structures of the world. Surrounded by
an amphitheatre of hills, with the Potomac at its feet,
it may remind you of the Capitol in Rome, with the
Alban and the Sabine hills in sight, and with the
Tiber at its feet. But the situation is grander than
that of the Roman Capitol. The edifice itself is not
unworthy of the situation. It has beauty of form and
sublimity in proportion, even if it lacks originality in
conception. In itself it is a work of art. It should
not receive in the way of ornamentation anything
which is not a work of art. Unhappily, this rule is
too often forgotten, or there would not be so few pictures
and marbles about us which we are glad to recognize.
But bad pictures and ordinary marbles warn us
against adding to their number.</p>

<p>Pardon me, if I call attention for one moment to
the few works of art in the Capitol which we might
care to preserve. Beginning with the Vice-President’s
room, which is nearest, we find an excellent and finished
portrait of Washington, by Peale. This is much
less known than the familiar portrait by Stuart, but
it is well worthy to be cherished. I never enter that
room without feeling its presence. Traversing the corridors,
we find ourselves in the spacious rotunda, where
are four pictures by Trumbull, truly historic in character,
by which great scenes live again before us. These
works have a merit of their own which will always
justify the place they occupy. Mr. Randolph, with
ignorant levity, once characterized that which represents
the signing of the Declaration of Independence<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[Pg 169]</a></span>
as a “shin-piece.” He should have known that there
is probably no picture, having so many portraits, less
obnoxious to such a gibe. If these pictures do not
belong to the highest art, they can never fail in interest
for the patriot citizen, while the artist will not
be indifferent to them. One other picture in the rotunda
is not without merit: I refer to the Landing
of the Pilgrims, by Weir, where there is a certain
beauty of color and a religious sentiment: but this
picture has always seemed to me exaggerated, rather
than natural. Passing from the rotunda to the House
of Representatives, we stand before a picture which,
as a work of art, is perhaps the choicest of all in the
Capitol. It is the portrait of Lafayette, by that consummate
artist, who was one of the glories of France,
Ary Scheffer. He sympathized with our institutions;
and this portrait of the early friend of our country
was a present from the artist to the people of the
United States. Few who look at it, by the side of
the Speaker’s chair, are aware that it is the production
of the rare genius which gave to mankind the
Christus Consolator and the Francesca da Rimini.</p>

<p>Turning from painting to sculpture, we find further
reason for caution. The lesson is taught especially by
that work of the Italian Persico, on the steps of the
Capitol, called by him Columbus, but called by others
“a man rolling nine-pins,”&mdash;for the attitude and the
ball he holds suggest this game. Near to this is a
remarkable group by Greenough, where the early settler
is struggling with the savage; while opposite
in the yard is the statue of Washington by the
same artist, which has found little favor because it is
nude, but which shows a mastery of art. There also<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[Pg 170]</a></span>
are the works of Crawford,&mdash;the <i>alto-rilievo</i> which
fills the pediment over the great door of the Senate
Chamber, and the statue of Liberty which looks down
from the top of the dome,&mdash;attesting a genius that
must always command admiration. There are other
statues, by a living artist. There are also the bronze
doors by Rogers, on which he labored long and well.
They belong to a class of which there are only a few
specimens in the world, and I have sometimes thought
they might vie with those famous doors at Florence,
which Michel Angelo hailed as worthy to be the gates
of Paradise. Our artist has pictured the whole life of
Columbus in bronze, while portraits of contemporary
princes, and of great authors who have illustrated the
life of the great discoverer, add to the completeness of
this artistic work.</p>

<p>Now, Sir, the chambers of the Capitol are to open
again for the reception of a work of art. It is to be
the statue of our martyred President. He deserves a
statue, and it should be here in Washington. But you
cannot expect to have, even of him, more than one
statue here in Washington. Such a repetition or reduplication
would be out of place. It would be too
much. There is one statue of Washington. There is
also a statue of Jefferson: I refer to the excellent
statue in front of the Executive Mansion, by the
French sculptor, David. There is also one statue of
Jackson. It is now proposed to add a statue of Lincoln.
I suppose you do not contemplate two statues,
or three, but only one. Who now shall make
that one, to find hospitality in the National Capitol?
Surely, whoever undertakes the work must be of ripe
genius, with ample knowledge of art, and of unquestioned<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[Pg 171]</a></span>
capacity,&mdash;the whole informed and inspired by
a prevailing sympathy with the martyr and the cause
for which he lived and died. Are you satisfied that
this youthful candidate, without ripeness of genius or
ample knowledge of art or unquestioned capacity, and
not so situated as to feel the full inspiration of his life
and character, should receive this remarkable trust?
She has never made a statue. Shall she experiment
on the historic dead, and place her attempt under this
dome? I am unwilling. When the statue of that beloved
President is set up here, where we shall look
upon it daily, and gather from it courage and consolation,
I wish it to be a work of art in truth and reality,
with living features animated by living soul, so that
we shall all hail it as the man immortal by his life,
doubly immortal through art. Anything short of this,
even if through your indulgence it finds a transient
resting-place here, will be removed whenever a correct
taste asserts its just prerogative.</p>

<p>Therefore, Sir, for the sake of economy, that you
may not heedlessly lavish the national treasure,&mdash;for
the sake of this Capitol, itself a work of art, that it
may not have anything in the way of ornamentation
which is not a work of art,&mdash;for the sake of the martyred
President, whose statue should be by a finished
artist,&mdash;and for the sake of art throughout the whole
country, that we may not set a pernicious example,&mdash;I
ask you to reject this resolution. When I speak for
art generally, I open a tempting theme; but I forbear.
Suffice it to say that art throughout the whole country
must suffer, if Congress crowns with its patronage anything
which is not truly artistic. By such patronage
you will discourage where you ought to encourage.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[Pg 172]</a></span></p>

<p>Mr. President, I make these remarks with sincere
reluctance; I am distressed in making them; but such
an appropriation, engineered so vigorously, and having
in its support such a concerted strength, must be met
plainly and directly. Do not condemn the frankness
you compel. If you wish to bestow a charity or a
gift, do it openly, without pretence of any patronage
bestowed upon art, or pretence of homage to a deceased
President. Bring forward your resolution appropriating
$10,000 to this youthful candidate. This I can deal
with. I can listen to your argument for charity, and
I assure you that I shall never be insensible to it. But
when you propose this large sum for a work of art in
the National Capitol in memory of the illustrious dead,
I am obliged to consider the character of the artist. I
wish it were otherwise, but I cannot help it.</p>

<div class="medium">

<p>The remarks of Mr. Sumner were opposed by Mr. Nesmith, of
Oregon, Mr. McDougall and Mr. Conness, of California, Mr. Yates
and Mr. Trumbull, of Illinois, Mr. Wade, of Ohio, and Mr. Cowan,
of Pennsylvania. In the course of the debate, Mr. Edmunds, of Vermont,
moved an amendment, requiring, that, before the first instalment
of $5,000 should be paid, the model should be to the “acceptance”
of the Secretary of the Interior. On this motion Mr. Sumner
spoke again.</p>

</div>

<p>I think this amendment had better be adopted. It
is only a reasonable precaution. The Senator from
Wisconsin [Mr. <span class="smcap">Howe</span>] alluded to a contract with
Mr. Stone. He is a known sculptor, whose works are
at the very doors of the Senate Chamber. The committee
who employed him must have been perfectly
aware of his character. When they entered into a contract
with him, there was no element of chance; they
knew what they were contracting for. But in the present<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[Pg 173]</a></span>
case there is nothing but chance, if there be not the
certainty of failure.</p>

<div class="medium">

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Conness.</span> How was it in the case of Mr. Powell?</p>

</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Sumner.</span> I am speaking of the present case.
One at a time, if you please. The person that you
propose to contract with notoriously has never made
a statue. All who have the most moderate acquaintance
with art know that it is one thing to make a bust
and quite another to make a statue. One may make
a bust and yet be entirely unable to make a statue,&mdash;just
as one may write a poem in the corner of a newspaper
and not be able to produce an epic. A statue
is art in one of its highest forms. There have been
very few artists competent to make a statue. There
is as yet but one instance that I recall of a woman
reasonably successful in such an undertaking. But
the eminent and precocious person to whom I refer
had shown a peculiar genius very early in life, had
enjoyed the rarest opportunities of culture, and had
vindicated her title as artist before she attempted this
difficult task. Conversing, as I sometimes have, with
sculptors, I remember how they always dwell upon
the difficulty of such a work. It is no small labor to
set a man on his legs, with proper drapery and accessories,
in stone or in bronze. Not many have been
able to do it, and all these had already experience
in art. Now there is no such experience here. Notoriously
this candidate is without it. There is no reason
to suppose that she can succeed. Therefore the
Senator from Vermont [Mr. <span class="smcap">Edmunds</span>] is wise, when
he proposes, that, before the nation pays $5,000 on account,
it shall have some assurance that the work is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[Pg 174]</a></span>
not absolutely a failure. Voltaire was in the habit of
exclaiming, in coarse Italian words, that “a woman cannot
produce a tragedy.” In the face of what has been
accomplished by Miss Hosmer, I do not venture on
the remark that a woman cannot produce a statue;
but I am sure that in the present case you ought to
take every reasonable precaution. Anything for this
Capitol must be “above suspicion.”</p>

<p>Sir, I did not intend, when I rose, to say anything
except directly upon the motion of the Senator from
Vermont; but, as I am on the floor, perhaps I may be
pardoned, if I advert for one moment&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<div class="medium">

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Howe.</span> Will the Senator allow me to ask him one
question, for information?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Sumner.</span> Certainly.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Howe.</span> It is, whether he supposes that by the examination
of a plaster model he could get any assurance
that the work in marble would be satisfactory.</p>

</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Sumner.</span> Obviously; for the chief work of the
artist is in the model. When this is done, the work
is more than half done,&mdash;almost all done. What remains
requires mechanical skill rather than genius.
In Italy, where are accomplished workmen in marble,
the artist leaves his model in their hands, contenting
himself with a few finishing strokes of the chisel.
Sometimes he does not touch the marble.</p>

<p>I was about to say, when interrupted, that I hoped
to be pardoned, if I adverted for one moment to the
onslaught made upon what I have said in this debate.
I do not understand it. I do not know why Senators
have given such rein to the passion for personality.
I made no criticism on any Senator, and no allusion,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[Pg 175]</a></span>
even, to any Senator. I addressed myself directly to
the question, and endeavored to treat it with all the
reserve consistent with proper frankness. Senators, one
after another, have attacked me personally. The Senator
from Oregon [Mr. <span class="smcap">Nesmith</span>] seemed to riot in
the business. The Senator from California [Mr. <span class="smcap">Conness</span>],
from whom I had reason to expect something
better, caught the spirit of the other Pacific Senator.
Sir, there was nothing in what I said to justify such
attack. But I will not proceed in the comments their
speeches invite; I turn away. There was, however,
one remark of the Senator from Oregon to which I
will refer. He complained that I was unwilling to
patronize native art, and that I dwelt on the productions
of foreign artists to the disparagement of
our own.</p>

<p>I am at a loss for the motive of this singular misrepresentation.
Let the Senator quote a sentence or
word which fell from me in disparagement of native
art. He cannot. I know the art of my country too
well, and think of it with too much of patriotic pride.
I alluded to only one foreign artist, and he was that
sympathetic and gifted Frenchman who has endowed
the Capitol with the portrait of Lafayette. The other
artists that I praised were all of my own country.
There was Rembrandt Peale, of Philadelphia, to whom
we are indebted for the portrait of Washington. There
was Trumbull, the companion of Washington, and one
of his military staff, who, quitting the toils of war, gave
himself to painting, under the inspiration of West, himself
an American, and produced works which I pronounced
the chief treasure of the rotunda. There also
was Greenough, the earliest American sculptor, and,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[Pg 176]</a></span>
until Story took the chisel, unquestionably the most
accomplished of all in the list of American sculptors.
He was a scholar, versed in the languages of antiquity
and modern times, who studied the art he practised
in the literature of every tongue. Of him I never fail
to speak in praise. There also was Crawford, an American
sculptor, born in New York, and my own intimate
personal friend, whose early triumphs I witnessed
and enjoyed. He was a true genius, versatile,
fertile, bold. His short life was crowned by the honors
of his profession, and he was hailed at home and
abroad as a great sculptor. How can I speak of this
friend of my early life except with admiration and
love? I alluded also to Rogers, an American artist,
from the West,&mdash;yes, Sir, from the West&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<div class="medium">

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Howard.</span> Who was educated in Michigan.</p>

</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Sumner.</span> Educated in Michigan,&mdash;who has given
to his country and to art those bronze doors, which I
did not hesitate to compare with the immortal doors
of Ghiberti in the Baptistery of Florence. These, Sir,
were the artists to whom I referred, and such was the
spirit in which I spoke. How, then, can any Senator
complain that I praised foreign artists at the expense
of artists at home? The remark, permit me to say, is
absolutely without foundation.</p>

<p>It is because I would not have the art of my own
country suffer, and because I would have its honors
follow merit, that I oppose the largess you offer. If
you really wish to set up a statue of our martyred
President, select an acknowledged sculptor of your own
country. Do not go to a foreigner, and do not go to
the unknown. There are sculptors born among us and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[Pg 177]</a></span>
already famous. Take one of them. There is Powers,
an artist of rarest skill with the chisel, of exquisite
finish,&mdash;perhaps with less variety and freshness than
some other artists, perhaps with less originality, but
having in himself many and peculiar characteristics
as a remarkable artist. Summon him. He has been
tried. Contracting with him, you know in advance
that you will have a statue not entirely unworthy of
the appropriation or of the place.</p>

<p>There is another sculptor of our country, whom I
should name first of all, if I were to express freely
my unbiased choice: I mean Story. He is the son of
the great jurist, and began life with his father’s mantle
resting upon him. His works of jurisprudence are
quoted daily in your courts. He is also a man of letters.
His contributions to literature in prose and verse
are in your libraries. To these he adds unquestioned
fame as sculptor. In the great exhibitions of Europe
his Cleopatra and his Saul have been recognized as
equal in art to the best of our time, and in the opinion
of many as better than the best. He brings to
sculpture not only the genius of an artist, but scholarship,
literature, study, and talent of every kind. Take
him. Let his name be associated with the Capitol by
a statue which I am sure will be the source of national
pride and honor.</p>

<p>I might mention other sculptors of our country
already known, and others giving assurance of fame.
My friend who sits beside me, the distinguished Senator
from New York [Mr. <span class="smcap">Morgan</span>], very properly reminds
me of the sculptor who does so much honor to
his own State. Palmer has a beautiful genius, which
he has cultivated for many years with sedulous care.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[Pg 178]</a></span>
He has experience. The seal of success is upon his
works. Let him make your statue. There is still
another artist, whose home is New York, whom I
would not forget: I refer to Brown, author of the
equestrian statue of Washington in New York. Of all
equestrian statues in our country this is the best, unless
Crawford’s statue at Richmond is its rival. It need
not shrink from comparison with equestrian statues in
the Old World. The talent that could seat the great
chief so easily in that bronze saddle ought to find welcome
in this Capitol. There are yet other sculptors;
but I confine my enumeration to those who have done
something more than promise excellence. And now
you turn from this native talent, already famous, to
offer a difficult and honorable duty to an untried person,
whose friends can claim for her nothing more than
the uncertain promise of such excellence in sculpture
as is consistent with the condition of her sex. Sir, I
will not say anything more.</p>

<div class="medium">

<p>The amendment of Mr. Edmunds was voted down,&mdash;Yeas 7, Nays
22,&mdash;and the joint resolution passed the Senate,&mdash;Yeas 23, Nays 9.<a name="FNanchor_57_57" id="FNanchor_57_57"></a><a href="#Footnote_57_57" class="fnanchor">[57]</a></p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>It was understood that the fair artist had received promises of support
from Senators in advance. The spirit of the debate on their part
belongs to the history of the case. Mr. Nesmith, of Oregon, said:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“Mr. President, if this was a mere matter of research, I should be very
much inclined to defer to the judgment of the Senator from Massachusetts;
but, as it is not, and as it requires no great learning, no particular devotion
to reading, to discover what is an exact imitation of Nature, I claim that
my judgment on such a subject is as good as his own.… He objects
to this young artist,&mdash;this young scion of the West, from the same land
from which Lincoln came,&mdash;a young person who manifests intuitive genius,
and who is able to copy the works of Nature without having perused the
immense tomes and the grand volumes of which the Senator may boast,&mdash;a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[Pg 179]</a></span>
person who was born and raised in the wilds of the West, and who is able
to copy its great works.”</p>

</div>

<p>And much more in a worse vein.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Mr. Conness, of California, adopted another style:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“And my idea of the great Senator from Massachusetts (by which name
I am very proud to call him, and which is so well deserved) is, that he
is never so great as when he rises and speaks in behalf of generosity, of
humanity, when he exhibits to us the intellect and the affections in that
happy commingling that is the sweetest and the most beautiful rule of
human life and action.”</p>

</div>

<p>Mr. Yates, of Illinois, bore his testimony:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“I almost feel that the Senator from Massachusetts is a barbarian [<i>laughter</i>]
of the highest order, in attacking this young lady.”</p>

</div>

<p>Mr. Cowan, of Pennsylvania, said:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“I have the highest respect for the opinions of my friend from Massachusetts
upon all classical subjects, and particularly upon those which relate
to most of the fine arts; but in statuary I propose to follow the lead
of my honorable friend from Ohio [Mr. <span class="smcap">Wade</span>], who I think is infinitely
superior.” [<i>Laughter.</i>]</p>

</div>

<p>On the other hand, Mr. Howard, of Michigan, said:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“I know, perhaps, as much of the ability of the young lady to whom
it is proposed to give this job as most members of this body. I have met
her frequently, as other members of this body have done; and surely she
has shown no lack of that peculiar talent known commonly as ‘lobbying,’
in pressing forward her enterprise and bringing it to the attention of Senators.”</p>

</div>

<p>The statue was made. Mr. Delano, Secretary of the Interior, in
a communication addressed to the Vice-President, January 10, 1871,
reports: “The statue in marble has been completed to my entire satisfaction,
and I have this day instructed the architect of the Capitol
to take charge of it.”<a name="FNanchor_58_58" id="FNanchor_58_58"></a><a href="#Footnote_58_58" class="fnanchor">[58]</a> The feelings of artists found expression in words
of Hiram Powers, the eminent American sculptor, at Florence, which
appeared in the New York <i>Evening Post</i>:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“I suppose that you, as well as all other well-wishers for art in our
country, have been mortified, if not really disgusted, at the success of the
Vinnie Ream statue of our glorious old Lincoln. An additional five thousand<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[Pg 180]</a></span>
dollars paid for this caricature! &mdash;&mdash; &mdash;&mdash; was bad enough; but
this last act of Congress, in favor of a female lobby member, who has no
more talent for art than the carver of weeping-willows on tombstones,
really fills the mind of the genuine student of art (who thinks that years
of profound study of art as a science are necessary) with despair.”</p>

<h3>ADDRESS.</h3>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/line.png" width="80" height="16" alt="" />
</div>

<p class="dropcap">MR. PRESIDENT,&mdash;More than a year has passed
since I last had the honor of addressing my fellow-citizens
of Massachusetts. I then dwelt on what seemed
the proper policy towards the States recently in rebellion,&mdash;insisting
that it was our duty, while renouncing
Indemnity for the past, to obtain at least Security for
the future; and this security, I maintained, could be
found only in exclusion of ex-Rebels from political power,
and in irreversible guaranties especially applicable to
the national creditor and the national freedman.<a name="FNanchor_59_59" id="FNanchor_59_59"></a><a href="#Footnote_59_59" class="fnanchor">[59]</a> During
intervening months, the country has been agitated by
this question, which was perplexed by unexpected difference
between the President and Congress. The President
insists upon installing ex-Rebels in political power,
and sets at nought the claim of guaranties and the idea
of security for the future, while he denies to Congress
any control over the question, taking it all to himself.
Congress asserts control, and endeavors to exclude ex-Rebels
from political power and establish guaranties, to
the end that there may be security for the future.
Meanwhile the States recently in rebellion, with the exception
of Tennessee, are without representation. Thus
stands the case.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[Pg 184]</a></span></p>

<p>The two parties are the President, on the one side,
and the people of the United States in Congress assembled,
on the other side,&mdash;the first representing the Executive,
the second representing the Legislative. It is
<i>The One Man Power</i> vs. <i>Congress</i>. Of course, each performs
its part in the government; but until now it
has always been supposed that the legislative gave law
to the executive, and not that the executive gave law
to the legislative. This irrational assumption becomes
more astonishing, when it is considered that the actual
President, besides being the creature of circumstance, is
inferior in ability and character, while the House of
Representatives is eminent in both respects. A President
who has already sunk below any other President,
even James Buchanan, madly undertakes to rule
a House of Representatives which there is reason to
believe is the best that has sat since the formation of
the Constitution. Looking at the two parties, we are
tempted to exclaim, Such a President dictating to such
a Congress! It was said of Gustavus Adolphus, that
he drilled the Diet of Sweden to vote or be silent at
the word of command; but Andrew Johnson is not
Gustavus Adolphus, and the American Congress is not
the Diet of Sweden.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The question at issue is one of the vastest ever presented
for practical decision, involving the name and
weal of the Republic at home and abroad. It is not
a military question; it is a question of statesmanship.
We are to secure by counsel what was won by war.
Failure now will make the war itself a failure; surrender
now will undo all our victories. Let the President
prevail, and straightway the plighted faith of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[Pg 185]</a></span>
Republic will be broken,&mdash;the national creditor and the
national freedman will be sacrificed,&mdash;the Rebellion itself
will flaunt its insulting power,&mdash;the whole country,
in length and breadth, will be disturbed,&mdash;and the
Rebel region will be handed over to misrule and anarchy.
Let Congress prevail, and all this will be reversed:
the plighted faith of the Republic will be preserved;
the national creditor and the national freedman
will be protected; the Rebellion itself will be trampled
out forever; the whole country, in length and breadth,
will be at peace; and the Rebel region, no longer harassed
by controversy and degraded by injustice, will
enjoy the richest fruits of security and reconciliation.
To labor for this cause may well tempt the young and
rejoice the old.</p>

<p>And now, to-day, I again protest against any present
admission of ex-Rebels to the great partnership of this
Republic, and I renew the claim of irreversible guaranties,
especially applicable to the national creditor and
the national freedman,&mdash;insisting now, as I did a year
ago, that it is our duty, while renouncing Indemnity
for the past, to obtain at least Security for the future.
At the close of a terrible war, wasting our treasure,
murdering our fellow-citizens, filling the land with funerals,
maiming and wounding multitudes whom Death
had spared, and breaking up the very foundations of
peace, our first duty is to provide safeguards for the
future. This can be only by provisions, sure, fundamental,
and irrepealable, fixing forever the results of
the war, the obligations of the Government, and the
equal rights of all. Such is the suggestion of common
prudence and of self-defence, as well as of common
honesty. To this end we must make haste slowly.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[Pg 186]</a></span>
States which precipitated themselves out of Congress
must not be permitted to precipitate themselves back.
They must not enter the Halls they treasonably deserted,
until we have every reasonable assurance of
future good conduct. We must not admit them, and
then repent our folly. The verses in which the satirist
renders the quaint conceit of the old Parliamentary
orator, verses revived by Mr. Webster, and on another
occasion used by myself, furnish the key to our duty:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="verse">“I hear a lion in the lobby roar:</div>
<div class="verse">Say, Mr. Speaker, shall we shut the door,</div>
<div class="verse">And keep him there? or shall we let him in,</div>
<div class="verse">To try if we can turn him out again?”<a name="FNanchor_60_60" id="FNanchor_60_60"></a><a href="#Footnote_60_60" class="fnanchor">[60]</a></div>
</div>
</div>

<p>I am against letting the monster in, until he is no
longer terrible in mouth or paw.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>But, while holding this ground of prudence, I desire
to disclaim every sentiment of vengeance or punishment,
and also every thought of delay or procrastination.
Here I do not yield to the President, or to
any other person. Nobody more anxious than I to
see this chasm closed forever.</p>

<p>There is a long way and a short way. There is a
long time and a short time. If there be any whose
policy is for the longest way or for the longest time,
I am not of the number. I am for the shortest way,
and also for the shortest time. And I object to the interference
of the President, because, whether intentionally
or unintentionally, he interposes delay and keeps
the chasm open. More than all others, the President,
by officious assumptions, has lengthened the way and
lengthened the time. Of this there can be no doubt.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[Pg 187]</a></span></p>

<p>From all quarters we learn that after the surrender
of Lee the Rebels were ready for any terms, if they
could escape with life. They were vanquished, and
they knew it. The Rebellion was crushed, and they
knew it. They hardly expected to save a small fraction
of property. They did not expect to save political
power. They were too sensible not to see that
participants in rebellion could not pass at once into
the copartnership of government. They made up their
minds to exclusion. They were submissive. There was
nothing they would not do, <em>even to the extent of enfranchising
the freedmen and providing for them homesteads</em>.
Had the National Government taken advantage of this
plastic condition, it might have stamped Equal Rights
upon the whole people, as upon molten wax, while it
fixed the immutable conditions of permanent peace.
The question of Reconstruction would have been settled
before it arose. It is sad to think that this was
not done. Perhaps in all history there is no instance
of such an opportunity lost. Truly should our country
say in penitential supplication, “We have left undone
those things which we ought to have done, and
we have done those things which we ought not to have
done.”</p>

<p>Do not take this on my authority. Listen to those
on the spot, who have seen with their own eyes. A
brave officer of our army writes from Alabama:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“I believe the mass of the people could have been easily
controlled, if none of the excepted classes had received pardon.
These classes did not expect anything more than life,
and even feared for that. Let me condense the whole subject.
At the surrender, the South could have been moulded
at will; but it is now as stiff-necked and rebellious as ever.”</p>

</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[Pg 188]</a></span></p>

<p>In the same vein another officer testifies from Texas:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“There is one thing, however, that is making against
the speedy return of quietness, not only in this State, but
throughout the entire South, <em>and that is the Reconstruction
policy of President Johnson</em>. It is doing more to unsettle
this country than people who are not practical observers of
its workings have any idea of. Before this policy was made
known, the people were prepared to accept anything. They
expected to be treated as rebels,&mdash;their leaders being punished,
and the property of others confiscated. But the moment
it was made known, all their assurance returned. Rebels
have again become arrogant and exacting; Treason stalks
through the land unabashed.”</p>

</div>

<p>This testimony might be multiplied indefinitely. From
city and country, from highway and by-way, there is but
one voice. When, therefore, the President, in opprobrious
terms, complains of Congress as interposing delay, I
reply to him: “No, Sir, it is you, who, by unexpected
and most perverse assumption, have put off the glad
day of security and reconciliation, so much longed for.
It is you who have inaugurated anew that malignant
sectionalism, which, so long as it exists, will keep the
Union divided in fact, if not in name. Sir, you are
the Disunionist.”</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Glance, if you please, at that Presidential policy&mdash;so
constantly called “my policy”&mdash;now so vehemently
pressed upon the country, and you will find that it
pivots on at least two alarming blunders, as can be
easily seen: <i>first</i>, in setting up the One Man Power
as the source of jurisdiction over this great question;
and, <i>secondly</i>, in using the One Man Power for the
restoration of Rebels to place and influence, so that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[Pg 189]</a></span>
good Unionists, whether white or black, are rejected,
and the Rebellion itself is revived in the new governments.
Each of these assumptions is an enormous
blunder. You see that I use a mild term to characterize
such a double-headed usurpation.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Pray, Sir, where in the Constitution do you find any
sanction of the One Man Power as source of this extraordinary
jurisdiction? I had always supposed that
the President was the Executive,&mdash;bound to see the
laws faithfully executed, but not empowered to make
laws. The Constitution expressly says: “The Executive
power shall be vested in a President of the United
States of America.” But the Legislative power is elsewhere.
According to the Constitution, “All Legislative
powers herein granted shall be vested in a Congress
of the United States, which shall consist of a
Senate and House of Representatives.” And yet the
President has assumed legislative power, even to the
extent of making laws and constitutions for States.
You all know, that, at the close of the war, when the
Rebel States were without lawful governments, he assumed
to supply them. In this business of Reconstruction
he assumed to determine who should vote,
and also to affix conditions for adoption by the conventions.
Look, if you please, at the character of this
assumption. The President, from the Executive Mansion
at Washington, reaches his long executive arm
into certain States and dictates constitutions. Surely
here is nothing executive; it is not even military. It
is legislative, pure and simple, and nothing else. It
is an attempt by the One Man Power to do what can
be done only by the legislative branch of Government.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[Pg 190]</a></span>
And yet the President, perversely absorbing to himself
all power over the reconstruction of the Rebel States,
insists that Congress must accept his work without
addition or subtraction. He can impose conditions:
Congress cannot. He can determine who shall vote:
Congress cannot. His jurisdiction is not only complete,
but exclusive. If all this be so, then has our President
a most extraordinary power, never before dreamed of.
He may exclaim, with Louis the Fourteenth, “The
State, it is I,” while, like this magnificent king, he sacrifices
the innocent, and repeats that fatal crime, the
revocation of the Edict of Nantes. His whole “policy”
is “revocation” of all that has been promised and all
we have a right to expect.</p>

<p>Here it is well to note a distinction, not without importance
in the issue between the President and Congress.
Nobody doubts that the President may, during
war, govern any conquered territory as commander-in-chief,
and for this purpose detail any military officer
as military governor. But it is one thing to govern a
State temporarily by military power, and quite another
thing to create a constitution for a State which shall
continue <em>when the military power has expired</em>. The former
is a military act, and belongs to the President;
the latter is a civil act, and belongs to Congress. On
this distinction I stand; and this is not the first time
that I have asserted it. Of course, governments set
up in this illegitimate way are necessarily illegitimate,
except so far as they acquire validity from time or
subsequent recognition. It needs no learned Chief Justice
of North Carolina solemnly to declare this. It is
manifest from the nature of the case.</p>

<p>But this illegitimacy becomes still more manifest,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[Pg 191]</a></span>
when it is known that the constitutions which the
President orders and tries to cram upon Congress have
never been submitted to popular vote. Each is the naked
offspring of an illegitimate convention called into
being by the President, in the exercise of illegitimate
power.</p>

<p>There is another provision of the Constitution, by
which, according to a judgment of the Supreme Court
of the United States, this question is referred to Congress,
and not to the President. I refer to the provision
that “<em>the United States</em> shall guaranty to every
State in this Union a republican form of government.”
On these words Chief Justice Taney, speaking for the
Supreme Court, has adjudged, that “it rests with Congress
to decide what government is the established one
in a State; for, as <em>the United States</em> guaranty to each
State a republican government, <em>Congress must necessarily
decide what government is established in the State</em>, before
it can determine whether it is republican or not”; and
that “unquestionably a military government established
as the permanent government of the State would not be
a republican government, and it would be the duty of
Congress to overthrow it.”<a name="FNanchor_61_61" id="FNanchor_61_61"></a><a href="#Footnote_61_61" class="fnanchor">[61]</a> But the President sets at
nought this commanding text, reinforced by the positive
judgment of the Supreme Court, and claims this
extraordinary power for himself, to the exclusion of
Congress. He is “the United States.” In him the Republic
is manifest. He can do all; Congress nothing.</p>

<p>And now the whole country is summoned by the
President to recognize State governments created by
constitutions thus illegitimate in origin and character.
Without considering if they contain the proper elements<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[Pg 192]</a></span>
of security for the future, or if they are republican
in form, and without any inquiry into the
validity of their adoption,&mdash;nay, in the very face of
testimony showing that they contain no elements of
security for the future, that they are not republican in
form, and that they have never been adopted by the
loyal people,&mdash;we are commanded to accept them;
and when we hesitate, the President, himself leading
the outcry, assails us with angry vituperation, blunted,
it must be confessed, by coarseness without precedent
and without bound. It is well that such a cause has
such an advocate.</p>

<p>Thus setting up the One Man Power as a source
of jurisdiction, the President has committed a blunder
of Constitutional Law, proceeding from an immense egotism,
in which the little pronoun “I” plays a gigantic
part. It is “<em>I</em>” vs. <em>The People of the United States
in Congress assembled</em>. On this unnatural blunder I
might say more; but I have said enough. My present
purpose is accomplished, if I make you see it
clearly.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The other blunder is of a different character. It is
giving present power to ex-Rebels, at the expense of
constant Unionists, white or black, and employing them
in the work of Reconstruction, so that the new governments
continue to represent the Rebellion. This
same blunder, when committed by one of the heroes
of the war, was promptly overruled by the President
himself; but Andrew Johnson now does what Sherman
was not allowed to do. The blunder is strange
and unaccountable.</p>

<p>Here the evidence is constant and cumulative. It<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[Pg 193]</a></span>
begins with his proclamation for the reconstruction of
North Carolina. Holden was appointed Provisional
Governor,&mdash;an officer unknown to law, and for whom
there was no provision,&mdash;although it was notorious that
he had been a member of the Convention which adopted
the Act of Secession, and that he signed it. Then
came Perry, Provisional Governor of South Carolina,
who, besides holding a judicial station under the Rebel
Government, was one of its Commissioners of Impressments.
I have a Rebel newspaper containing one of
his advertisements in the latter character. There also
was Parsons, Provisional Governor of Alabama, who
in 1863 introduced into the Legislature of that State
formal resolutions tendering to Jefferson Davis “hearty
thanks for his good labors in the cause of our common
country, together with the assurance of continued
support,”&mdash;and afterwards, in 1864, denounced our national
debt, exclaiming in the Legislature: “Does any
sane man suppose we will consent to pay their [the
United States] war debt, contracted in sending armies
and navies to burn our towns and cities, to lay waste
our country,&mdash;whose soldiers have robbed and murdered
our peaceful inhabitants?” Such were the agents
appointed by the President to institute loyal governments.
But this selection becomes more strange and
unaccountable, when it is considered that all this was
done in defiance of law.</p>

<p>There is a recent enactment of Congress requiring
that no person shall be appointed to any office of the
United States, unless such office has been created by
law.<a name="FNanchor_62_62" id="FNanchor_62_62"></a><a href="#Footnote_62_62" class="fnanchor">[62]</a> And there is another enactment of Congress, providing
that all officers, civil or military, before entering<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[Pg 194]</a></span>
upon their official duties or receiving any salary or compensation,
shall take an oath declaring that they have
held no office under the Rebellion or given any aid
thereto.<a name="FNanchor_63_63" id="FNanchor_63_63"></a><a href="#Footnote_63_63" class="fnanchor">[63]</a> In face of these enactments, which are sufficiently
explicit, the President began his work of Reconstruction
by appointing civilians to an office absolutely
unknown to law, when besides they could not
take the required oath of office; and to complete the
disregard of Congress, he fixed their salary, and paid
it out of the funds of the War Department.</p>

<p>Of course such proceeding was an instant encouragement
and license to all ex-Rebels, no matter how much
blood was on their hands. Rebellion was at a premium.
It was easy to see, that, if these men were
good enough to be governors of States, in defiance of
Congress, all others in the same political predicament
would be good enough for inferior offices. And it was
so. From top to bottom these States were organized
by men who had been warring on their country. Ex-Rebels
were appointed by the governors or chosen by
the people everywhere. Ex-Rebels sat in Conventions
and in Legislatures. Ex-Rebels became judges, justices
of the peace, sheriffs, and everything else,&mdash;while the
faithful Unionist, white or black, was rejected. As
with Cordelia, his love was “according to his bond, nor
more nor less”; but all this was of no avail. How
often during the war have I pleaded for such patriots,
and urged to every effort for their redemption!&mdash;and
now, when our arms have prevailed, it is they who
are cast down, while the enemies of the Republic are
exalted. The pirate Semmes returns from his ocean
cruise to be chosen Probate Judge,&mdash;leaping from the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[Pg 195]</a></span>
deck of the Ship Alabama to the judicial bench of the
State Alabama. In New Orleans the Rebel mayor at
the surrender to the national flag is once more mayor,
and employs his regained power in the terrible massacre
which rises in judgment against the Presidential
policy. Persons are returned to Congress whose service
in the Rebellion makes it impossible for them to
take the oath of office,&mdash;as in the case of Georgia, which
selects as Senators Herschel V. Johnson, a Senator of
the Rebel Congress, and Alexander H. Stephens, Vice-President
of the Rebellion. These are instances; but
from these learn all.</p>

<p>There is nothing within reach of the President which
he has not lavished on ex-Rebels. The power of pardon
and amnesty, like the power of appointment, has
been used for them, wholesale and retail. It would
have been easy to affix a condition to every pardon,
requiring, that, before it took effect, the recipient should
carve out of his estate a homestead for every one of
his freedmen, and thus secure to each what they all
covet so much, a piece of land. But the President
did no such thing, although, in the words of the old
writ, “often requested so to do.” Such a condition
would have helped the loyal freedmen, rather than the
rebel master. In the same spirit, while undertaking
to determine who shall be voters, all colored persons,
howsoever loyal, were disfranchised, while all white
persons, except certain specified classes, although black
with rebellion, were constituted voters on taking a simple
oath of allegiance, thus investing ex-Rebels with a
prevailing power.</p>

<p>Partisans of the Presidential “policy” are in the
habit of declaring it a continuation of the policy of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[Pg 196]</a></span>
the martyred Lincoln. This is a mistake. Would that
he could rise from his bloody shroud to repel the calumny!
Happily, he has left his testimony behind, in
words which all who have ears to hear can hear. The
martyr presented the truth bodily, when he said, in
suggestive metaphor, that we must “build up from
the sound materials”; but his successor insists upon
building from materials rotten with treason and gaping
with rebellion. On another occasion, the martyr said that
“an attempt to guaranty and protect a <em>revived</em> State
government, constructed in whole or <em>in preponderating
part</em> from <em>the very element</em> against whose hostility and
violence it is to be protected, is <em>simply absurd</em>.”<a name="FNanchor_64_64" id="FNanchor_64_64"></a><a href="#Footnote_64_64" class="fnanchor">[64]</a> But
this is the very thing the President is now attempting.
He is constructing State governments, not merely in
preponderating part, but <em>in whole</em>, from the hostile element.
Therefore he departs openly from the policy of
the martyred Lincoln.</p>

<p>The martyr says to his successor that the policy adopted
is “simply absurd.” He is right, although he might
say more. Its absurdity is too apparent. It is as if,
in abolishing the Inquisition, the inquisitors had been
continued under another name, and Torquemada had
received a fresh license for cruelty. It is as if King
William, after the overthrow of James the Second, had
made the infamous Jeffreys Lord Chancellor. Common
sense and common justice cry out against the outrage;
and yet this is the Presidential “policy” now so passionately
commended to the American people.</p>

<p>A state, according to Aristotle, is a “copartnership,”
and I accept the term as especially applicable to our
government. And now the President, in the exercise<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[Pg 197]</a></span>
of the One Man Power, decrees that communities
lately in rebellion shall be taken at once into
our “copartnership.” I object to the decree as dangerous
to the Republic. I am not against pardon, clemency,
or magnanimity, except where they are at the
expense of good men. I trust that they will always
be practised; but I insist that recent rebels shall not
be admitted, without proper precautions, to the business
of the firm. And I insist also that the One Man
Power shall not be employed to force them into the
firm.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Such are two pivotal blunders. It is not easy to
see how he has fallen into these, so strong were his
early professions the other way. The powers of Congress
he had distinctly admitted. Thus, as early as
24th July, 1865, he had sent to Sharkey, acting by his
appointment as Provisional Governor of Mississippi, this
despatch: “It must, however, be distinctly understood
that the restoration to which your proclamation refers
<em>will be subject to the will of Congress</em>.” Nothing could
be more positive. And he was equally positive against
the restoration of Rebels to power. You do not forget,
that, in accepting his nomination as Vice-President, he
rushed forward to declare that the Rebel States must
be remodelled, that confiscation must be enforced, and
that Rebels must be excluded from the work of Reconstruction.
His language was plain and unmistakable.
Announcing that “government must be fixed on the
principles of <em>eternal justice</em>,” he declared, that, “if the
man who gave his influence and his means to destroy
the Government should be permitted to participate in
the great work of reorganization, then all the precious<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[Pg 198]</a></span>
blood so freely poured out will have been wantonly
spilled, and all our victories go for nought.” True,
very true. Then, in words of surpassing energy, he
cried out, that “the great plantations must be seized
and divided into small farms,” and that “traitors should
take a back seat in the work of restoration.” Perhaps
the true rule was never expressed with more homely
and vital force than in this last saying, often repeated
in different forms, “For Rebels, back seats.” Add that
other saying, as often repeated, “Treason must be made
odious,” and you have two great principles of just reconstruction,
once proclaimed by the President, but now
practically disowned by him.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>You will ask how the President fell. This is hard to
say, certainly, without much plainness of speech. Mr.
Seward openly confesses that he counselled the present
fatal “policy.” Unquestionably the Blairs, father and
son, did the same. So also, I doubt not, did Mr. Preston
King. It is easy to see that Mr. Seward was not
a wise counsellor. This is not his first costly blunder.
In formal despatches he early announced that “the
rights of the States, and the condition of every human
being in them, will remain subject to exactly the same
laws and forms of administration, whether the revolution
shall succeed or whether it shall fail.”<a name="FNanchor_65_65" id="FNanchor_65_65"></a><a href="#Footnote_65_65" class="fnanchor">[65]</a> And now he
labors for the fulfilment of his own prophecy. Obviously,
from the beginning, he has failed to comprehend
the Rebellion, while in nature he is abnormal and eccentric,
jumping like the knight on the chess-board,
rather than moving on straight lines. Undoubtedly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[Pg 199]</a></span>
the influence of such a man over the President has
not been good. But the President himself is his own
worst counsellor, as he is his own worst defender. He
does not open his mouth without furnishing evidence
against himself.</p>

<p>The brave words with which he accepted his nomination
as Vice-President resounded through the country.
He was elected. Then followed two scenes, each
of which filled the people with despair. The first was
of the new Vice-President taking the oath of office&mdash;in
the presence of the foreign ministers, the judges of
the Supreme Court, and the Senate&mdash;while in such a
condition that his attempted speech became trivial and
incoherent, and he did not know the name of the Secretary
of the Navy, who is now the devoted supporter
of his policy, as he has been his recent travelling companion.
One month and one week thereafter President
Lincoln was assassinated. The people, wrapt in
affliction at the great tragedy, trembled as they beheld
a drunken man ascend the heights of power. But they
were generous and forgiving,&mdash;almost forgetful. He
was our President, and hands were outstretched to welcome
and sustain him. His early utterances as President,
although commonplace, loose, and wordy, gave assurance
that the Rebellion and its authors would find
little favor. Treason was to be made odious.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>At this time my own personal relations with him
commenced. I had known him slightly while he was
in the Senate; but I lost no time in seeing him after
he became President. He received me kindly. I hope
that I shall not err, if I allude briefly to what passed
between us. You are my constituents, and I wish you<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[Pg 200]</a></span>
to know the Presidential mood at that time, and also
what your representative attempted.</p>

<p>Being in Washington during the first month of the
new Administration, destined to fill such an unhappy
place in history, I saw the President frequently, at the
private house he then occupied, or at his office in the
Treasury. He had not yet taken possession of the Executive
Mansion. The constant topic was “Reconstruction,”
which was considered in every variety of aspect.
More than once I ventured to press the duty and renown
of carrying out the principles of the Declaration
of Independence, and of founding the new governments
on the consent of the governed, without distinction of
color. To this earnest appeal he replied, as I sat with
him alone, in words which I can never forget: “On
this question, Mr. Sumner, there is no difference between
us; you and I are alike.” Need I say that I
was touched to the heart by this annunciation, which
seemed to promise a victory without a battle? Accustomed
to controversy, I saw clearly, that, if the President
declared himself for the Equal Rights of All, the
good cause must prevail without controversy. Expressing
to him my joy and gratitude, I remarked that there
should be no division in the great Union party,&mdash;that
no line should be run through it, on one side of which
would be gentlemen calling themselves “the President’s
friends,” but we should be kept all together as
one seamless garment. To this he promptly replied,
“I mean to keep you all together.” Nothing could
be better. We were to be kept all together on the
principle of Equal Rights. As I walked away, that
evening, the battle of my life seemed ended, while
the Republic rose before me, refulgent in the blaze of
assured freedom, an example to the nations.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[Pg 201]</a></span></p>

<p>On another occasion, during the same period, the case
of Tennessee was discussed. I expressed the earnest
hope that the President would use his influence directly
for the establishment of impartial suffrage in that State,
saying that in this way Tennessee would be put at the
head of the returning column and be made an example,&mdash;in
one word, that all the other States would be
obliged to dress on Tennessee. The President replied,
that, if he were at Nashville, he would see this accomplished.
I could not help rejoining, that he need not
be at Nashville, for at Washington his hand was on
the long end of the lever with which he could easily
move all Tennessee,&mdash;referring, of course, to the powerful,
but legitimate, influence the President might exercise
in his own State by the expression of his desires.
Let me confess that his hesitation disturbed me; but I
attributed it to unnecessary caution, rather than to infidelity.
He had been so positive with me, how could
I suspect him?</p>

<p>At other times the conversation was renewed. Such
was my interest in the question, that I could not see
the President without introducing it. As I was about
to return home, I said that I desired, even at the risk
of repetition, to make some parting suggestions on the
constant topic, and that, with his permission, I would
proceed point by point, as was the habit of the pulpit
in former days. He smiled, and observed pleasantly,
“Have I not always listened to you?” I replied, “You
have; and I am grateful.” After remarking that the
Rebel region was still in military occupation, and that
it was the plain duty of the President to use his temporary
power for the establishment of correct principles,
I proceeded to say: “First, see to it that no newspaper<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[Pg 202]</a></span>
is allowed which is not thoroughly loyal, and
does not speak well of the National Government and
of Equal Rights”; and here I reminded him of the saying
of the Duke of Wellington, that in a place under
martial law an unlicensed press is as impossible as
on the deck of a ship of war. “Secondly, let the officers
that you send, as military governors or otherwise,
be known for devotion to Equal Rights, so that their
names alone will be a proclamation, while their simple
presence will help educate the people”; and here I
mentioned Major-General Carl Schurz, who still held his
commission in the army, as such a person. “Thirdly,
encourage the population to resume the profitable labors
of agriculture, commerce, and manufactures without delay,&mdash;but
for the present to avoid politics. Fourthly,
keep the whole region under these good influences, and
at the proper moment hand over the subject of Reconstruction,
with the great question of Equal Rights, to
the judgment of Congress, where it belongs.” All this
the President received with perfect kindness, and I
mention this with the more readiness because I remember
to have seen in the papers a very different
statement.</p>

<p>Only a short time afterwards there was a change,
which seemed like a somersault or an apostasy; and
then ensued a strange sight. Instead of faithful Unionists,
recent Rebels thronged the Presidential antechambers,
rejoicing in new-found favor. They made
speeches at the President, and he made speeches at
them. A mutual sympathy was manifest. On one
occasion the President announced himself a “Southern
man” with “Southern sympathies,” thus quickening
that sectional flame which good men hoped to see<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[Pg 203]</a></span>
quenched forever. Alas! if, after all our terrible sacrifices,
we are still to have a President who does not
know how to spurn every sectional appeal and make
himself representative of all! Unhappily, whatever
the President said or did was sectional. He showed
himself constantly a sectionalist. Instead of telling the
ex-Rebels who thronged the Presidential antechambers,
as he should have done, that he was their friend,
that he wished them well from the bottom of his heart,
that he longed to see their fields yield an increase,
with peace in all their borders, and that, to this end,
he counselled them to pursue agriculture, commerce,
and manufactures, and for the present to say nothing
about politics,&mdash;instead of this, he sent them away
talking and thinking of nothing but politics, and frantic
for the reëstablishment of a sectional power. Instead
of designating officers of the army as military
governors, which I had supposed he would do, he appointed
ex-Rebels, who could not take the oath required
by Congress of all officers of the United States, and
they in turn appointed ex-Rebels to office under them;
so that participation in the Rebellion found reward,
and treason, instead of being made odious, became the
passport to power. Everywhere ex-Rebels came out of
hiding-places. They walked the streets defiantly, and
asserted their old domination. Under auspices of the
President, a new campaign was planned against the
Republic, and they who failed in open war now sought
to enter the very citadel of political power. Victory,
purchased by so much loyal blood and treasure, was little
better than a cipher. Slavery itself revived in the
spirit of Caste. Faithful men who had been trampled
down by the Rebellion were trampled down still more<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[Pg 204]</a></span>
by these Presidential governments. For the Unionist
there was no liberty of the press or liberty of speech,
and the lawlessness of Slavery began to rage anew.</p>

<p>Every day brought tidings that the Rebellion was
reappearing in its essential essence. Amidst all professions
of submission, there was immitigable hate to
the National Government, and prevailing injustice to
the freedman. This was last autumn. I was then in
Boston. Moved by desire to arrest this fatal tendency,
I appealed by letter to members of the Cabinet, entreating
them to stand firm against a “policy” which
promised nothing but disaster. As soon as the elections
were over, I appealed directly to the President
himself, by a telegraphic despatch, as follows:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p class="right medium">“<span class="smcap">Boston</span>, November 12, 1865.</p>

<p class="noindent">“<span class="smcap">To the President of the United States, Washington.</span></p>

<p>“As a faithful friend and supporter of your administration,
I most respectfully petition you to suspend for the present
your policy towards the Rebel States. I should not present
this prayer, if I were not painfully convinced that thus far
it has failed to obtain any reasonable guaranties for that
security in the future which is essential to peace and reconciliation.
To my mind, it abandons the freedmen to the
control of their ancient masters, and leaves the national debt
exposed to repudiation by returning Rebels. The Declaration
of Independence asserts the equality of all men, and that
rightful government can be founded only on the consent of
the governed. I see small chance of peace, unless these
great principles are practically established. Without this,
the house will continue divided against itself.</p>

<p class="sig">“<span class="smcap">Charles Sumner</span>,<br />
“<i>Senator of the United States</i>.”</p>

</div>

<p>Reaching Washington Saturday evening, immediately<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[Pg 205]</a></span>
before the opening of the last session of Congress, I lost
no time in seeing the President. I was with him that
evening three hours. I found him changed in temper
and purpose. How unlike that President who, only a
few days after arrival at power, made me feel so happy
in the assurance of agreement on the great question!
No longer sympathetic, or even kindly, he was harsh,
petulant, and unreasonable. Plainly, his heart was with
ex-Rebels. For the Unionist, white or black, who had
borne the burden of the day, he had little feeling.
He would not see the bad spirit of the Rebel States,
and insisted that the outrages there were insufficient
to justify exclusion from Congress. The following dialogue
ensued.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p><span class="smcap">The President.</span> Are there no murders in Massachusetts?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Sumner.</span> Unhappily, yes,&mdash;sometimes.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The President.</span> Are there no assaults in Boston? Do
not men there sometimes knock each other down, so that
the police is obliged to interfere?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Sumner.</span> Unhappily, yes.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The President.</span> Would you consent that Massachusetts,
on this account, should be excluded from Congress?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Sumner.</span> No, Mr. President, I would not.</p>

</div>

<p>And here I stopped, without remarking on the entire
irrelevancy of the inquiry. I left the President
that night with the painful conviction that his whole
soul was set as flint against the good cause, and that
by the assassination of Abraham Lincoln the Rebellion
had vaulted into the Presidential chair. Jefferson
Davis was then in the casemates at Fortress Monroe,
but Andrew Johnson was doing his work.</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="verse">“Ah! what avails it, …</div>
<div class="verse">If the gulled conqueror receives the chain,</div>
<div class="verse">And flattery subdues, when arms are vain?”</div>
</div>
</div>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[Pg 206]</a></span></p>
<p>From this time forward I was not in doubt as to
his “policy,” which asserted a condition of things in
the Rebel region inconsistent with the terrible truth.
It was, therefore, natural that I should characterize one
of his messages, covering over the enormities there,
as “whitewashing.” This mild term was thought by
some too strong. Subsequent events have shown that
it was too weak. The whole Rebel region is little better
than a “whited sepulchre.” It is that saddest of
all sepulchres, the sepulchre of Human Rights. The
dead men’s bones are the remains of faithful Union
soldiers, dead on innumerable fields, or stifled in the
pens of Andersonville and Belle Isle,&mdash;also of constant
Unionists, white and black, whom we are sacredly
bound to protect, now murdered on highways
and by-ways, or slaughtered at Memphis and New Orleans.
The uncleanness is injustice, wrong, and outrage,
having a loathsome stench; and the President
is engaged in “whiting” over these things, so that they
shall not be seen by the American people. To do this,
he garbles a despatch of Sheridan, and abuses the hospitality
of the country by a travelling speech, where
every word, not foolish, vulgar, and vindictive, is a
vain attempt at “whitewashing.”</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Meanwhile the Presidential madness is more than
ever manifest. It has shown itself in frantic effort to
defeat the Constitutional Amendment proposed by Congress
for adoption by the people. By this Amendment
certain safeguards are established. Citizenship is defined,
and protection is assured at least in what are
called civil rights. The basis of representation is fixed
on the number of voters, so that, if colored citizens are<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[Pg 207]</a></span>
not allowed to vote, they will not by their numbers
contribute to representative power, and one voter in
South Carolina will not be able to neutralize two voters
in Massachusetts or Illinois. Ex-Rebels who had taken
an oath to support the Constitution are excluded from
office, National or State. The National debt is guarantied,
while the Rebel debt and all claim for slaves are
annulled. All these essential safeguards are rudely rejected
by the President.</p>

<p>The madness that would set aside provisions so essentially
just, whose only error is inadequacy, has
broken forth naturally in brutal utterance, where he
has charged persons by name with seeking his life,
and has stimulated a mob against them. It is difficult
to surpass the criminality of this act. The violence
of the President has provoked violence. His
words were dragon’s teeth, which have sprung up armed
men. Witness Memphis; witness New Orleans. Who
can doubt that the President is author of these tragedies?
Charles the Ninth of France was not more
completely author of the Massacre of St. Bartholomew
than Andrew Johnson is author of the recent massacres
now crying out for judgment. History records that
the guilty king was pursued in the silence of night by
the imploring voices of murdered men, mingled with
curses and imprecations, while ghosts stalked through
his chamber, until he sweated blood from every pore;
and when he came to die, his soul, wrung with the
tortures of remorse, stammered out, “Ah, nurse, my
good nurse! what blood! what murders! Oh, what
bad counsels I followed! Lord God, pardon me! have
mercy on me!” Like causes produce like effects. The
blood at Memphis and New Orleans must cry out until<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[Pg 208]</a></span>
heard, and a guilty President may suffer the retribution
which followed a guilty king.</p>

<p>The evil he has done already is on such a scale that
it is impossible to measure it, unless as you measure
an arc of the globe. I doubt if in all history there is
any ruler who in the same brief space of time has done
so much. There have been kings and emperors, proconsuls
and satraps, who have exercised tyrannical power;
but facilities of communication now lend swiftness and
extension to all evil influences, so that the President
is able to do in a year what in other days would
have taken a life. Nor is the evil confined to any narrow
spot. It is coextensive with the Republic. Next
to Jefferson Davis stands Andrew Johnson as its worst
enemy. The whole country has suffered; but the Rebel
region has suffered most. He should have sent peace;
instead, he sent a sword. Behold the consequences!</p>

<p>In support of a cruel “policy” he has not hesitated
to use his enormous patronage. President Lincoln
said, familiarly, that, as the people had continued
him in office, he supposed they meant that others
should be continued also; and he refused to make
removals. But President Johnson announces “rotation
in office”; and then, warming in anger against all
failing to sustain his “policy,” he roars that he will
“kick them out.” Men appointed by the martyred
Lincoln are to be “kicked out” by the successor,
while he pretends to sustain the policy of the martyr.
The language of the President is most suggestive. He
“kicks” the friends of his well-loved predecessor; and
he also “kicks” the careful counsel of that well-loved
predecessor, that we must “build up from the sound
materials.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[Pg 209]</a></span></p>

<p>That I may give practical direction to these remarks,
let me tell you plainly what must be done. In the
first place, Congress must be sustained in its conflict
with the One Man Power; and, in the second place,
ex-Rebels must not be hurried back to power. Bearing
in mind these two things, the way is easy. Of
course, the Constitutional Amendment must be adopted.
As far as it goes, it is well; but it does not go far
enough. More is necessary. Impartial suffrage must
be established. A homestead must be secured to every
freedman, if in no other way, through the pardoning
power. If to these is added education, there will be a
new order of things, with liberty of the press, liberty
of speech, and liberty of travel, so that Wendell Phillips
may speak freely in Charleston or Mobile. There is
an old English play under the name of “The Four P’s.”
Our present desires may be symbolized by four E’s,&mdash;standing
for Emancipation, Enfranchisement, Equality,
and Education. Securing these, all else will follow.</p>

<p>I can never cease to regret that Congress hesitated
by proper legislation to assume temporary jurisdiction
over the whole Rebel region. To my mind the power
was ample and unquestionable, whether in the exercise
of belligerent rights or in the exercise of rights directly
from the Constitution itself. In this way everything
needful might have been accomplished. Through this
just jurisdiction the Rebel communities might have been
fashioned anew, and shaped to loyalty and virtue. The
President lost a great opportunity at the beginning.
Congress has lost another. But it is not too late. If
indisposed to assume this jurisdiction by an Enabling
Act constituting provisional governments, there are
many things Congress may do, acting indirectly or directly.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[Pg 210]</a></span>
Acting indirectly, it may insist that Emancipation,
Enfranchisement, Equality, and Education shall
be established as conditions precedent to the recognition
of any State whose institutions have been overthrown
by rebellion.<a name="FNanchor_66_66" id="FNanchor_66_66"></a><a href="#Footnote_66_66" class="fnanchor">[66]</a> Acting directly, it may, by Constitutional
Amendment, or by simple legislation, fix all
these forever.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>You are aware that from the beginning I have insisted
upon Impartial Suffrage as the only certain guaranty
of security and reconciliation. I renew this persistence,
and mean to hold on to the end. Every argument,
every principle, every sentiment is in its favor.
But there is one reason which at this moment I place
above all others: it is <em>the necessity of the case</em>. You
require the votes of colored persons in the Rebel States
to sustain the Union itself. Without their votes you
cannot build securely for the future. Their ballots will
be needed in time to come much more than their muskets
were needed in time past. For the sake of the
white Unionists, and for their protection,&mdash;for the sake
of the Republic itself, whose peace is imperilled, I appeal
for justice to the colored race. Give the ballot to
the colored citizen, and he will be not only assured in
his own rights, but the timely defender of yours. By
a singular Providence your security is linked inseparably
with the recognition of his rights. Deny him, if
you will: it is at your peril.</p>

<p>But it is said, Leave this question to the States; and
State rights are pleaded against the power of Congress.
This has been the cry: at the beginning, to prevent effort<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[Pg 211]</a></span>
against the Rebellion; and now, at the end, to prevent
effort against a revival of the Rebellion. Whichsoever
way we turn, we encounter the cry. But yielding
now, you will commit the very error of President
Buchanan, when at the beginning he declared that we
could not “coerce” a State. Nobody now doubts that
a State in rebellion may be “coerced”; and to my
mind it is equally clear that a State just emerging
from rebellion may be “coerced” to the condition required
by the public peace.</p>

<p>There are powers of Congress, not derived from the
Rebellion, which are adequate to this exigency; and
now is the time to exercise them, and thus complete
the work. It was the Nation that decreed Emancipation,
and the Nation must see to it, by every obligation
of honor and justice, that Emancipation is secured.
It is not enough that Slavery is abolished in name.
The Baltimore platform, on which President Johnson
was elected, requires the “utter and complete <em>extirpation</em>
of Slavery from the soil of the Republic”; but this
can be accomplished only by the eradication of every
inequality and caste, so that all shall be equal before
the law.</p>

<p>Be taught by Russia. The Emperor there did not content
himself with naked Emancipation. He followed
this glorious act with minute provisions for rights of all
kinds,&mdash;as, to hold property, to sue and testify in court,
<em>to vote</em>, and <em>to enjoy the advantages of education</em>. All this
by the same power which decreed Emancipation.</p>

<p>Be taught also by England, speaking by her most
illustrious statesmen, who solemnly warn against trusting
to any local authorities for justice to the colored
race. I begin with Burke, who saw all questions with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[Pg 212]</a></span>
the intuitions of the statesman, and expressed himself
with the eloquence of the orator. Here are his words,
uttered in 1792:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“I have seen what has been done by the West Indian
Assemblies [in reference to the improvement of the condition
of the negro]. It is arrant trifling. They have done little;
and what they have done is good for nothing,&mdash;<em>for it is
totally destitute of an executory principle</em>.”<a name="FNanchor_67_67" id="FNanchor_67_67"></a><a href="#Footnote_67_67" class="fnanchor">[67]</a></p>

</div>

<p>Should we leave this question to the States, we, too,
should find all they did “arrant trifling,” and wanting
“an executory principle.”</p>

<p>Edmund Burke was followed shortly afterwards by
Canning, who, in 1799, exclaimed:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“There is something in the nature of the relation between
the despot and his slave which must vitiate and render nugatory
and null whatever laws the former might make for
the benefit of the latter,&mdash;which, however speciously these
laws might be framed, however well adapted they might
appear to the evils which they were intended to alleviate,
must infallibly be marred and defeated in the execution.”<a name="FNanchor_68_68" id="FNanchor_68_68"></a><a href="#Footnote_68_68" class="fnanchor">[68]</a></p>

</div>

<p>Then again he says:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“Trust not the masters of slaves in what concerns legislation
for slavery. However specious their laws may appear,
depend upon it, they must be ineffectual in their application.
It is in the nature of things that they should be so.…
Their laws can never reach, will never cure the evil.…
There is something in the nature of absolute authority, in the
relation between master and slave, which makes despotism,
in all cases and under all circumstances, an incompetent and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[Pg 213]</a></span>
unsure executor even of its own provisions in favor of the
objects of its power.”<a name="FNanchor_69_69" id="FNanchor_69_69"></a><a href="#Footnote_69_69" class="fnanchor">[69]</a></p>

</div>

<p>The same testimony was repeated at a later day by
Brougham, who, in one of his most remarkable speeches,
while protesting against leaving to the colonies legislation
for the freedmen, said,&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“I entirely concur in the observations of Mr. Burke, repeated
and more happily expressed by Mr. Canning: that the
masters of slaves are not to be trusted with making laws
upon slavery; that nothing they do is ever found effectual;
and that, if, by some miracle, they ever chance to enact a
wholesome regulation, it is always found to want what Mr.
Burke calls <em>the executory principle</em>,&mdash;it fails to execute itself.”<a name="FNanchor_70_70" id="FNanchor_70_70"></a><a href="#Footnote_70_70" class="fnanchor">[70]</a></p>

</div>

<p>Such is the concurring authority of three statesmen
orators, whose eloquent voices unite to warn against
trusting the freedmen to their old masters.</p>

<p>Reason is in harmony with this authoritative testimony.
It is not natural to suppose that people who
have claimed property in their brethren, God’s children,&mdash;who
have indulged that “wild and guilty fantasy
that man can hold property in man,”&mdash;will become
at once the kind and just legislators of freedmen.
It is unnatural to expect it. Even if they have made
up their minds to Emancipation, they are, from inveterate
habit and prejudice, incapable of justice to the
colored race. There is the President himself, who once
charmed the country and the age by announcing himself
the “Moses” of their redemption; and yet he now<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[Pg 214]</a></span>
exerts all his mighty power against the establishment
of safeguards without which there can be no true redemption.
In present discussion, the old proslavery
spirit that was in him, with hostility to principles and
to men, comes out anew,&mdash;as, on the application of
heat, the old tunes frozen up in the bugle of Baron
Munchausen were set a-going and broke forth freshly.
People do not change suddenly or completely. The
old devils are not all cast out at once. Even the best
of converts sometimes backslide. From so grave a
writer as Southey, in his History of Brazil, we learn
that a woman accustomed to consider human flesh an
exquisite dainty was converted to Christianity in extreme
old age. The faithful missionary strove at once
to minister to her wants, and asked if there was any
particular food she could take, suggesting various delicacies;
to all which the venerable convert replied:
“My stomach goes against everything. There is but
one thing which I think I could touch. If I had the
little hand of a little tender Tapuya boy, I think I
could pick the little bones. But, woe is me! there
is nobody to go out and shoot one for me!”<a name="FNanchor_71_71" id="FNanchor_71_71"></a><a href="#Footnote_71_71" class="fnanchor">[71]</a> In
similar spirit our Presidential convert now yearns for
a taste of those odious pretensions which were a part
of Slavery.</p>

<p>Now, when a person thus situated, with great responsibilities
to his country and to history, bound by
public professions and by political associations, who
has declared himself against Slavery, and has every
motive for perseverance to the end,&mdash;when such a
person openly seeks to preserve its odious pretensions,
are we not admonished again how unsafe it must be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[Pg 215]</a></span>
to trust old masters, under no responsibility and no
pledge, with the power of legislating for freedmen? I
protest against it.</p>

<p>I claim this power for the Nation. If it be said
that the power has never been employed, then I say
that the time has come for its employment. I claim
it on at least three several grounds.</p>

<p>1. There is the Constitutional Amendment, already
adopted by the people, which invests Congress with
plenary powers to secure the abolition of Slavery,&mdash;ay,
its “extirpation,” according to the promise of the
Baltimore platform,&mdash;including the right to sue and
testify in court, and the right also to vote. The distinction
attempted between what are called <em>civil</em> rights
and <em>political</em> rights is a modern invention. These two
words in their origin have the same meaning. One
is derived from the Latin, and the other from the Greek.
Each signifies what pertains to a <em>city</em> or <em>citizen</em>. Besides,
if the elective franchise seem “appropriate” to
assure the “extirpation” of Slavery, Congress has the
same power to secure this right that it has to secure
the right to sue and testify in courts, which it has
already done. Every argument, every reason, every
consideration, by which you assert the power for the
protection of colored persons in what are called <em>civil</em>
rights, is equally strong for their protection in what
are called <em>political</em> rights. In each case you legislate
to the same end,&mdash;that the freedman may be maintained
in the liberty so tardily accorded; and the legislation
is just as “appropriate” in one case as in the
other.</p>

<p>2. There is also that distinct clause of the Constitution
requiring the United States to “guaranty to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[Pg 216]</a></span>
every State in this Union <em>a republican form of government</em>.”
Here is a source of power as yet unused. The
time has come for its use. Let it be declared that a
State which disfranchises any portion of its citizens
by a discrimination in its nature insurmountable, as
in the case of color, cannot be considered a republican
government. The principle is obvious, and its practical
adoption would ennoble the country and give to
mankind a new definition of republican government.</p>

<p>3. Another reason with me is peremptory. There
is no discrimination of color in the allegiance you require.
Colored citizens, like white citizens, owe allegiance
to the United States; therefore they may claim
protection as an equivalent. In other words, allegiance
and protection must be reciprocal. As you claim allegiance
of colored citizens, you must accord protection.
One is the consideration of the other. And this protection
must be in all the rights of citizens, civil and
political. Thus again do I bring home to the National
Government this solemn duty. If this has not been
performed in times past, it was on account of the tyrannical
influence of Slavery, which perverted our Government.
But, thank God! that influence is overthrown.
Vain are the victories of the war, if this influence
continues to tyrannize. Formerly the Constitution
was interpreted always for Slavery. I insist,
that, from this time forward, it shall be interpreted
always for Freedom. This is the great victory of the
war,&mdash;or rather, it is the crowning result of all the
victories.</p>

<p>One of the most important battles in the world’s
history was that of Tours, in France, where the Mahometans,
who had come up from Spain, contended<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[Pg 217]</a></span>
with the Christians under Charles the Hammer. On
this historic battle Gibbon remarks, that, had the result
been different, “perhaps the interpretation of the
Koran would now be taught in the schools of Oxford,
and her pulpits might demonstrate to a circumcised
people the sanctity and truth of the revelation of Mahomet.”<a name="FNanchor_72_72" id="FNanchor_72_72"></a><a href="#Footnote_72_72" class="fnanchor">[72]</a>
Thus was Christianity saved; and thus by
our victories has Liberty been saved. Had the Rebels
prevailed, Slavery would have had voices everywhere,
even in the Constitution itself. But it is Liberty now
that must have voices everywhere, and the greatest
voice of all in the National Constitution and the laws
made in pursuance thereof.</p>

<p>In this cause I cannot be frightened by words. There
is a cry against “Centralization,” “Consolidation,” “Imperialism,”&mdash;all
of which are bad enough, when dedicated
to any purpose of tyranny. As the House of
Representatives is renewed every two years, it is inconceivable
that such a body, fresh from the people
and promptly returning to the people, can become a
Tyranny, especially when seeking safeguards for Human
Rights. A government inspired by Liberty is as wide
apart from Tyranny as Heaven from Hell. There can
be no danger in Liberty assured by central authority;
nor can there be danger in any powers to uphold Liberty.
Such a centralization, such a consolidation,&mdash;ay,
Sir, such an imperialism,&mdash;would be to the whole
country a well-spring of security, prosperity, and renown.
As well find danger in the Declaration of Independence
and the Constitution itself, which speak with
central power; as well find danger in those central laws<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[Pg 218]</a></span>
which govern the moral and material world, binding
men together in society and keeping the planets wheeling
in their orbits.</p>

<p>Often during recent trials the cause of our country
has assumed three different forms, each essential in itself
and yet together constituting a unit, like the shamrock,
or white clover, with triple leaf, originally used
to illustrate the Trinity. It was Three in One. These
three different forms were: first, the national forces;
secondly, the national finances; and, thirdly, the ideas
entering into the controversy. The national forces and
the national finances have prevailed. The ideas are
still in question, and even now you debate with regard
to the great rights of citizenship. Nobody doubts that
the army and navy fall plainly within the jurisdiction
of the National Government, and that the finances fall
plainly within this jurisdiction; but the rights of citizenship
are as thoroughly national as army and navy or
finances. You cannot without peril cease to regulate
the army and navy, nor without peril cease to regulate
the finances; but there is equal peril in abandoning
the rights of citizens, who, wherever they may be, in
whatever State, are entitled to protection from the
Nation. An American citizen in a foreign land enjoys
the protecting hand of the National Government.
That protecting hand should be his not less at home
than abroad.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Fellow-citizens, allow me to gather the whole case
into brief compass. The President, wielding the One
Man Power, has assumed a prerogative over Congress
utterly unjustifiable, while he has dictated a fatal “policy”
of Reconstruction, which gives sway to Rebels, puts<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[Pg 219]</a></span>
off the blessed day of security and reconciliation, and
leaves the best interests of the Republic in jeopardy.
Treacherous to party, false to the great cause, and unworthy
of himself, he has set his individual will against
the people of the United States in Congress assembled.
Forgetful of truth and decency, he has assailed members
as “assassins,” and has denounced Congress itself
as a revolutionary body, “called or assuming to be the
Congress of the United States,” and “hanging upon the
verge of the Government,”<a name="FNanchor_73_73" id="FNanchor_73_73"></a><a href="#Footnote_73_73" class="fnanchor">[73]</a>&mdash;as if this most enlightened
and patriot Congress did not contain the embodied
will of the American people. To you, each and all, I
appeal to arrest this madness. Your votes will be the
first step. The President must be taught that usurpation
and apostasy cannot prevail. He who promised
to be Moses, and has become Pharaoh, must be overthrown.
And may the Egyptians that follow him share
the same fate, so that it shall be said now as aforetime,
“And the Lord overthrew the Egyptians in the
midst of the sea!”</p>

<p class="dropcap">DEAR SIR,&mdash;I am glad that our colored fellow-citizens
are about to assemble in convention to
consider how best to promote their welfare, and to
secure those equal rights to which they are justly entitled.</p>

<p>You seek nothing less than a revolution. But you
will succeed. The revolution must prevail. What are
called civil rights have been accorded already; but
every argument for these is equally important for political
rights, which cannot be denied without the grossest
wrong. Let the colored citizens persevere. Let
them calmly, but constantly, insist upon those equal
rights which are the promise of our institutions. They
should appeal to Congress, and they should also appeal
to the courts.</p>

<p>I cannot doubt the power and duty of Congress and
of the courts to set aside every inequality founded on
color. It will be the wonder of posterity that a constitution
absolutely free from all discrimination of color
was so perverted in its construction as to sanction this
discrimination,&mdash;as if such a wrong could be derived

<p class="hanging">Resolutions declaring the true principles of Reconstruction,
the jurisdiction of Congress over the whole subject, the
illegality of existing governments in the Rebel States, and
the exclusion of such States, with such illegal governments,
from representation in Congress, and from voting
on Constitutional Amendments.</p>

</div>

<p class="dropcap"><i>RESOLVED</i>, (1.) That in the work of Reconstruction
it is important that no false step should be
taken, interposing obstacle or delay, but that, by careful
provisions, we should make haste to complete the
work, so that the unity of the Republic shall be secured
on permanent foundations, and fraternal relations once
more established among all the people thereof.</p>

<p>2. That this end can be accomplished only by following
the guiding principles of our institutions as declared
by our fathers when the Republic was formed,
and that neglect or forgetfulness of these guiding principles
must postpone the establishment of union, justice,
domestic tranquillity, the general welfare, and the
blessings of liberty, which, being the declared objects<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[Pg 225]</a></span>
of the National Constitution, must therefore be the essential
aim of Reconstruction itself.</p>

<p>3. That Reconstruction must be conducted by Congress,
and under its constant supervision; that under
the National Constitution Congress is solemnly bound
to assume this responsibility; and that, in the performance
of this duty, it must see that everywhere
throughout the Rebel communities loyalty is protected
and advanced, while the new governments are fashioned
according to the requirements of a Christian
commonwealth, so that order, tranquillity, education,
and human rights shall prevail within their borders.</p>

<p>4. That, in determining what is a republican form of
government, Congress must follow implicitly the definition
supplied by the Declaration of Independence;
and, in the practical application of this definition, it
must, after excluding all disloyal persons, take care that
new governments are founded on the two fundamental
truths therein contained: first, that all men are equal
in rights; and, secondly, that all just government stands
only on the consent of the governed.</p>

<p>5. That all proceedings with a view to Reconstruction
originating in Executive power are in the nature
of usurpation; that this usurpation becomes especially
offensive, when it sets aside the fundamental truths of
our institutions; that it is shocking to common sense,
when it undertakes to derive new governments from a
hostile population just engaged in armed rebellion; and
that all governments having such origin are necessarily
illegal and void.</p>

<p>6. That it is the duty of Congress to proceed with
Reconstruction; and to this end it must assume jurisdiction
of the States lately in rebellion, except so far<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[Pg 226]</a></span>
as that jurisdiction has been already renounced, and it
must recognize only the Loyal States, or States having
legal and valid legislatures, as entitled to representation
in Congress, or to a voice in the adoption of Constitutional
Amendments.</p>

<div class="medium">

<p>These resolutions were read and ordered to be printed. Mr. Sumner,
after remarking that he saw “no chance for peace in the Rebel
States until Congress does its duty by assuming jurisdiction over that
whole region,” proposed to read a letter he had just received from
Texas.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. McDougall</span> [of California]. Allow me to ask the Senator to read
the signature. Let the name of the writer be given.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Sumner.</span> I shall not read the signature&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. McDougall.</span> Ah! ha!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Sumner.</span> And for a very good reason,&mdash;that I could not read
the signature without exposing the writer to violence, if not to death.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Davis</span> [of Kentucky]. Mr. President, I rise to a question of order.
I ask if the reading of the letter by the Senator from Massachusetts is in
order.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The President</span> <i>pro tempore</i>. In the opinion of the Chair, a Senator,
in making a speech to the Senate, has a right to read from a letter in his
possession, if he deems proper.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Davis.</span> I ask whether it is in order for the Senator from Massachusetts
to make a speech at this time.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The President</span> <i>pro tempore</i>. The Chair sees nothing disorderly in it.</p>

</div>

<p>Mr. Sumner then read the letter, and remarked:&mdash;</p>

</div>

<p>I should not read this letter, if I were not entirely
satisfied of the character and intelligence of the writer.
It is in the nature of testimony which the Senate cannot
disregard. It points the way to duty. We must,
Sir, follow the suggestions of this patriot Unionist, and
erase the governments under which these outrages are
perpetrated. The writer calls them “sham governments.”
They are governments having no element of
vitality. They are disloyal in origin, and they share
the character of the Rebellion itself. We must go forth<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[Pg 227]</a></span>
to meet them, and the spirit in which they have been
organized, precisely as in years past we went forth to
meet the Rebellion. The Rebellion, Sir, has assumed
another form. Our conflict is no longer on the field of
battle, but here in this Chamber, and in the Chamber
at the other end of the Capitol. Our strife is civic,
but it should be none the less strenuous.</p>

<div class="medium">

<p>December 10th, the Suffrage Bill for the District of Columbia,
considered in the former session of Congress,<a name="FNanchor_74_74" id="FNanchor_74_74"></a><a href="#Footnote_74_74" class="fnanchor">[74]</a> was again taken up for
consideration, when Mr. Cowan, of Pennsylvania, moved to amend it
by striking out the word “male,” so that there should be no limitation
of sex. December 12th, after debate, this motion was rejected,&mdash;Yeas
9, Nays 37. The Senators voting in the affirmative were Mr.
Anthony, of Rhode Island, Mr. Gratz Brown, of Missouri, Mr. Buckalew,
of Pennsylvania, Mr. Cowan, of Pennsylvania, Mr. Foster, of
Connecticut, Mr. Nesmith, of Oregon, Mr. Patterson, of Tennessee,
Mr. Riddle, of Delaware, and Mr. Wade, of Ohio.</p>

<p>The following amendment was then moved by Mr. Dixon, of Connecticut:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“<i>Provided</i>, That no person who has not heretofore voted in this District
shall be permitted to vote, unless he shall be able, at the time of offering to
vote, to read, and also to write his own name.”</p>

</div>

<p>December 13th, at this stage of the debate, Mr. Sumner said:&mdash;</p>

</div>

<p class="dropcap">MR. PRESIDENT,&mdash;I have already voted against
the motion to strike out the word “male,” and
I shall vote against the pending proposition to fix an
educational test. In each case I am governed by the
same consideration.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[Pg 229]</a></span></p>

<p>In voting against striking out the word “male,” I
did not intend to express any opinion on the question,
which has at last found its way into the Senate Chamber,
whether women shall be invested with the elective
franchise. That question I leave untouched, contenting
myself with the remark, that it is obviously the great
question of the future,&mdash;at least one of the great questions,&mdash;which
will be easily settled, whenever the
women in any considerable proportion insist that it
shall be settled. And so, in voting against an educational
test, I do not mean to say that under other circumstances
such test may not be proper. But I am
against it now.</p>

<p>The present bill is for the benefit of the colored race
in the District of Columbia. It completes Emancipation
by Enfranchisement. It entitles all to vote without
distinction of color. The courts and the rail-cars
of the District, even the galleries of Congress, have
been opened. The ballot-box must be opened also.
Such is my sense not only of the importance, but of the
necessity of this measure, so essential does it appear to
me for the establishment of peace, security, and reconciliation,
which I so earnestly covet, that I am unwilling
to see it clogged, burdened, or embarrassed by anything
else. I wish to vote on it alone. Therefore,
whatever the merits of other questions, I have no difficulty
in putting them aside until this is settled.</p>

<p>The bill for Impartial Suffrage in the District of Columbia
concerns directly some twenty thousand colored
persons, whom it will lift to the adamantine platform
of Equal Rights. If regarded simply in its influence
on the District, it would be difficult to exaggerate its
value; but when regarded as an example to the whole<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[Pg 230]</a></span>
country, under the sanction of Congress, its value is
infinite. In the latter character it becomes a pillar of
fire to illumine the footsteps of millions. What we do
here will be done in the disorganized States. Therefore
we must be careful that what we do here is best
for the disorganized States.</p>

<p>If the bill could be confined in influence to the District,
I should have little objection to an educational
test as an experiment. But it cannot be limited to
any narrow sphere. Practically, it takes the whole
country into its horizon. We must, therefore, act for
the whole country. This is the exigency of the present
moment.</p>

<p>Now to my mind nothing is clearer than the present
necessity of suffrage for all colored persons in the disorganized
States. It will not be enough, if you give it
to those who read and write; you will not in this way
acquire the voting force needed there for the protection
of Unionists, whether white or black. You will not
secure the new allies essential to the national cause.
As you once needed the muskets of blacks, so now you
need their votes,&mdash;and to such extent that you can act
with little reference to theory. You are bound by the
necessity of the case. Therefore, when asked to open
suffrage to women, or when asked to establish an educational
standard for our colored fellow-citizens, I cannot,
on the present bill, simply because the controlling necessity
under which we act will not allow it. By a
singular Providence, we are constrained to this measure
of Enfranchisement for the sake of peace, security, and
reconciliation, so that loyal persons, white or black, may
be protected, and that the Republic may live. Here, in
the national capital, we begin the real work of Reconstruction,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[Pg 231]</a></span>
by which the Union will be consolidated forever.</p>

<div class="medium">

<p>The amendment of Mr. Dixon was rejected,&mdash;Yeas 11, Nays 34.
The Senators voting in the affirmative were Mr. Anthony, Mr. Buckalew,
Mr. Dixon, Mr. Doolittle, Mr. Fogg, Mr. Foster, Mr. Hendricks,
Mr. Nesmith, Mr. Patterson, Mr. Riddle, and Mr. Willey.</p>

<p>The bill then passed the Senate,&mdash;Yeas 32, Nays 13. On the
next day it passed the other House, and, being vetoed by President

<div class="medium">

<p>January 3d, in the Senate, Mr. Sumner introduced the following
resolution:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“<i>Resolved</i>, That the Committee on the Judiciary be directed to consider
if any further legislation is needed to prevent the enslavement of Indians
in New Mexico or any system of peonage there, and especially to prohibit
the employment of the army of the United States in the surrender
of persons claimed as peons.”</p>

</div>

<p>Mr. Sumner then called attention to facts showing the necessity of
action. He said:&mdash;</p>

</div>

<p class="dropcap">I think you will be astonished, when you learn
that the evidence is complete, showing in a Territory
of the United States the existence of slavery
which a proclamation of the President has down to
this day been powerless to root out. During the life
of President Lincoln, I more than once appealed to
him, as head of the Executive, to expel this evil from
New Mexico. The result was a proclamation, and also
definite orders from the War Department; but, in the
face of proclamation and definite orders, the abuse has
continued, and, according to official evidence, it seems
to have increased.</p>

<div class="medium">

<p>Mr. Sumner here read from the Report of the Commissioner on
Indian Affairs, also from the Report of a Special Agent, containing
the correspondence of army officers, including an order from the Assistant<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[Pg 233]</a></span>
Inspector General in New Mexico to aid in the rendition of
fugitive peons to their masters, and then remarked:&mdash;</p>

</div>

<p>The special Indian agent who reports this correspondence
very aptly adds:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“The aid of Congress is invoked to stop the practice.”</p>

</div>

<p>I hope the Department of War will communicate
directly with General Carleton, under whose sanction
this order has been made, and I hope that our Committee
on the Judiciary will consider carefully if further
legislation is not needed to meet this case. A
Presidential proclamation has failed; orders of the War
Department have failed; the abuse continues, and we
have a very learned officer in the army of the United
States undertaking to vindicate it.</p>

<div class="medium">

<p>The reference was changed to the Committee on Military Affairs,
and the resolution was adopted. Subsequently, Mr. Wilson, of Massachusetts,
Chairman of the Committee on Military Affairs, reported
a bill to abolish and forever prohibit the system of peonage in the
Territory of New Mexico and other parts of the United States, which
became a law.<a name="FNanchor_76_76" id="FNanchor_76_76"></a><a href="#Footnote_76_76" class="fnanchor">[76]</a></p>

<div class="medium">

<p>January 3, 1867, in the Senate, Mr. Sumner introduced the following
resolution:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“<i>Resolved</i>, That the Committee on the Judiciary be directed to consider
if any action of Congress be needed, either in the way of legislation or of a
supplementary Amendment to the Constitution, to prevent the sale of persons
into slavery for a specified term by virtue of a decree of court.”</p>

</div>

<p>In its consideration, he called attention to cases like the following:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“<span class="smcap">Public Sale.</span> The undersigned will sell at the court-house door, in
the city of Annapolis, at twelve o’clock, M., on Saturday, 8th December,
1866, a negro man named Richard Harris, for six months, convicted at the
October term, 1866, of the Anne Arundel County Circuit Court, for larceny,
and sentenced by the Court to be sold as a slave.</p>

<p>“Terms of sale, cash.</p>

<p class="sig">“<span class="smcap">Wm. Bryan</span>,<br />
“<i>Sheriff Anne Arundel County</i>.</p>

<p class="noindent">“December 3, 1866.”</p>

</div>

<p>He then remarked:&mdash;</p>

</div>

<p class="dropcap">It seems to me, Sir, that these cases throw upon Congress
the duty at least of inquiry; and I wish the
Committee on the Judiciary, from which proceeded the
Constitutional Amendment abolishing Slavery, would
enlighten us on the validity of these proceedings, and
the necessity or expediency of further action to prevent<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">[Pg 235]</a></span>
their repetition. I do not know that the Civil Rights
Bill, which was afterward passed, may not be adequate
to meet these cases; but I am not clear on that point.</p>

<p>When the Constitutional Amendment was under consideration,
I objected positively to the phraseology. I
thought it an unhappy deference to an original legislative
precedent at an earlier period of our history. I
regretted infinitely that Congress was willing, even indirectly,
to sanction any form of slavery. But the Senate
supposed that the phrase “involuntary servitude,
except as a punishment for crime whereof the party
shall have been duly convicted,” was simply applicable
to ordinary imprisonment. At the time I feared that
it might be extended so as to cover some form of slavery.
It seems now that it is so extended, and I wish
the Committee to consider whether the remedy can be
applied by Act of Congress, or whether we must not
go further and expurgate that phraseology from the
text of the Constitution itself.</p>

<div class="medium">

<p>After remarks by Mr. Reverdy Johnson and Mr. Creswell, of Maryland,
Mr. Sumner said:&mdash;</p>

</div>

<p>The remarks of the Senator from Maryland [Mr.
<span class="smcap">Johnson</span>] seem to justify entirely the resolution I
have brought forward. I have simply called attention
to what was already notorious, but with a view to
action. I am not sure, that, under the Constitutional
Amendment, this abuse may not be justified, and I desire
to have the opinion of the Committee after ample
consideration.</p>

<p>This, Sir, is not the first time in which incidents
like this have occurred. I remember, that, many years
ago, when I first came into this Chamber, the good<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[Pg 236]</a></span>
people whom I represent were shocked at reading that
four colored sailors of Massachusetts had been sold into
slavery in the State of Texas. I did what I could to
obtain their liberation, but without success. I applied
directly to the Senator from Texas at that time, who
will be remembered by many as the able General Rusk,
beside whom I sat on the other side of the Chamber.
He openly vindicated the power of the court to make
such a sale, and I have never heard anything of those
poor victims from that time to this. Under the operation
of the Constitutional Amendment I trust they are
now emancipated; but I am not sure of that, since they
are in Texas.</p>

<div class="medium">

<p>The resolution was adopted. Subsequently Mr. Creswell moved the
printing of a bill, introduced by him at the preceding session, to protect
children of African descent from being enslaved in violation of the Constitution
of the United States.</p>

<p>February 20th, Mr. Poland, from the Committee on the Judiciary,
to whom this bill had been referred, reported that its object was accomplished
by the Civil Rights and the Habeas Corpus Acts, and that no
further legislation was needed. In a conversation that ensued, Mr.
Sumner said:&mdash;</p>

</div>

<p>It strikes me the practical question is, whether recent
incidents have not admonished us that there is
a disposition to evade the statute, and under the protection
of State laws&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<div class="medium">

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Trumbull</span> [of Illinois]. That is the very thing the
statute guards against.</p>

</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Sumner.</span> But the statute was not effective to
prevent those incidents.</p>

<div class="medium">

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Trumbull.</span> Will any statute, if it is not executed?</p>

</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Sumner.</span> But when apprised of an evasion, I
ask whether it is not expedient to counteract that evasion<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">[Pg 237]</a></span>
specifically and precisely, so that there shall be
no possible excuse? Liberty is won by these anxious
trials. Those who represent her are accustomed to take
case by case and difficulty by difficulty,&mdash;overcoming
them, if they can. Secure first the general principle, as
in the Constitutional Amendment,&mdash;then legislation as
extensive or minute as the occasion requires. Let it
be “precept upon precept, line upon line,” so long as
any such outrage can be shown.</p>

<p>I would not seem pertinacious, though I do not know
that I can err by any pertinacity on a question of Human
Liberty. I feel that we are painfully admonished,
by incidents occurring under our very eyes, that we
ought to do something to tighten that great Constitutional
Amendment. It contains in its text words
which I regret. I regretted them at the time; I proposed
to strike them out; and now they return to
plague the inventor. There should have been no recognition
in the Constitutional Amendment of any possibility
of Slavery. The reply is, that the Amendment,
if properly interpreted, does not recognize the possibility
of Slavery being legal in any just sense. But it is
misinterpreted,&mdash;has been so in an adjoining State;
and who can tell that it will not be so now in every
one of the Southern States? I am sorry that the Committee
has not reported the bill.</p>

<p>The Senate last night passed a bill, on the report
of my colleague, to prohibit slavery and peonage in
New Mexico. Under the Constitutional Amendment,
I take it, that bill was unnecessary, it was superfluous.
But we have found a difficulty in that Territory. There
has been outrage; slavery in some form exists there;
and consequently my colleague was right, when he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">[Pg 238]</a></span>
brought his Committee to the conclusion that they
must meet it by specific enactment. Where the abuse
appears, we must root it out. That is Radicalism. So
long as a human being is held as a slave anywhere
under this flag, from the Atlantic to the Pacific coast,
there is occasion for your powerful intervention; and
if there is ambiguity or failure in existing statutes, then
you must supply another statute.</p>

<div class="medium">

<p>This session of Congress was occupied by efforts to restrain and
limit the appointing power of the President. The differences between
the President and Congress increased daily. Among measures
considered by Congress was a bill to regulate the tenure of offices,
known as the Tenure of Office Bill.</p>

<p>January 15th, Mr. Sumner moved to amend this bill by adding a
new section:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“<i>And be it further enacted</i>, That all officers or agents, except clerks
of Departments, now appointed by the President or by the head of any

</div>

<p>Mr. Edmunds, of Vermont, who reported the pending bill, opposed
the amendment. Mr. Sumner followed.</p>

</div>

<p class="dropcap">MR. PRESIDENT,&mdash;The proposition I offer now I
moved last week on another bill, in a slightly
different form, but it was substantially the same. I did
not then understand that there was objection to it in
principle. It was opposed as not germane to the bill
in hand; or, if germane, its adoption on that bill was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">[Pg 240]</a></span>
supposed in some way to embarrass its passage. On
that ground, as I understand, it was opposed,&mdash;not
on its merits. Senators who spoke against it avowed
their partiality for it, if I understood them aright,&mdash;declared,
that, if they had an opportunity on any proper
bill, they would vote for it.</p>

<p>Well, Sir, I move it on another bill, to which I believe
all will admit it is entirely germane. There is no
suggestion that it is not germane. It is completely in
order. But the objection of the Senator from Vermont,
if I understand, is, that it may interfere with the symmetry
of his bill, and introduce an element which he,
who has that bill in charge and now conducts it so
ably, had not intended to introduce. Very well, Sir;
that may be said; but I do not think it a very strong
objection.</p>

<p>The Senator is mistaken, if he supposes that the
amendment would endanger the bill. Just the contrary.
It would give the bill strength.</p>

<div class="medium">

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Howe.</span> Merit.</p>

</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Sumner.</span> It would give it both strength and
merit,&mdash;because it is a measure which grows out of
the exigency of the hour. His bill on a larger scale
is just such a measure. It grows out of the present
exigency, and this is its strength and its merit. We
shall pass that, if we do pass it,&mdash;and I hope we shall,&mdash;to
meet a crisis. We all feel its necessity. But the
measure which I now move grows equally out of the
present exigency. If ingrafted on the bill, it will be,
like the original measure, to meet the demands of the
moment. It will be because without it we shall leave
something undone which we ought to do.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">[Pg 241]</a></span></p>

<p>Now, I ask Senators, is there any one who doubts
that under the circumstances such a provision ought to
pass? Is there any one who doubts, after what we
have seen on a large scale, that the President, for the
time being at least, ought to be deprived of the extraordinary
function he has exercised? He has announced
in public speech that he meant to “kick out of office”
present incumbents; and it was in this proceeding, that,
on his return to Washington, he undertook to remove
incumbents wherever he could. It cannot be doubted,
Sir, that we owe protection to these incumbents, so far
as possible. This is an urgent duty. If the Senator
from Vermont will tell me any other way in which this
can be promoted successfully, I shall gladly follow him;
but until then I must insist that it shall share the fortunes
of the bill, “pursue the triumph and partake the
gale.” If the bill succeeds, then let this measure, which
is as good as the bill.</p>

<p>But the suggestion is made, that the amendment
should be matured in a committee. Why, Sir, it is
very simple. Any one can mature it who applies his
mind to it for a few moments. It has already been before
the Senate for several days, discussed once, twice,
three times, I think, not elaborately, but still discussed,
so that its merits have become known; and beside its
discussion in open Senate, I am a witness that it has
been canvassed in conversation much. Many Senators
have applied their minds to it, and I may say that
in offering it now I speak not merely for myself, but
for others, and the proposition, in the form in which
I present it, is not merely my own, but it is that of
many others, to whose careful supervision it has been
submitted. Therefore I say that it is matured, so far<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">[Pg 242]</a></span>
as necessary, and there is no reason why the Senate
should not act upon it. Why postpone what is in
itself so essentially good? Why put off to some
unknown future the chance of applying the remedy
to an admitted abuse? Is there any one here who
says that this is not an abuse, that here is not a tyrannical
exercise of power? No one. Then, Sir, let us
apply the remedy. This is the first chance we can get.
Take it.</p>

<p>Mr. Fessenden was “not disposed to overturn a system which has
recommended itself to the experience of the Government, recommended
itself to the most approved mode of doing the business of the country
for years, with which no fault whatever has been found in its practical
operation, simply because at this time we are in this ‘muss’ with
regard to appointments.” He was “opposed utterly to the amendment.”
Mr. Sumner replied:&mdash;</p>

</div>

<p>It is very easy to answer an argument, when you
begin by exaggerating consequences. Now, Sir, the
Senator warns us against my proposition, because it
would impose so much business upon the Senate. Is
that true? He reminds us of the number of appointments
we should be obliged to act upon in the Internal
Revenue Department. How many? The assistant assessors.
What others? Those can be counted.</p>

<div class="medium">

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Cragin.</span> Inspectors under the internal revenue laws.</p>

</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Sumner.</span> Inspectors also: those can all be
counted. He then reminds us of the officers in the
custom-houses. They can all be counted. It would
not act on clerks in the custom-houses; it acts only,
if at all, on officers of the custom-houses, in a certain
sense superior, some with considerable responsibility.
They can all be counted. It is easy to say that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">[Pg 243]</a></span>
we shall be obliged to deal with many thousands; but
I say, nevertheless, they can all be counted.</p>

<p>But are we not obliged to deal with many thousand
postmasters, and also with many thousand officers in
the army? How have we carried this great war along?
The Senate has acted always upon all the nominations
of the Executive for the national army, beginning
with the general and ending with a second lieutenant.
Every one comes before the Senate; and what is the
consequence? The Executive has a direct responsibility
to the Senate with regard to every army appointment.
But you are not disposed to renounce that responsibility
because it brings into this Chamber many
thousand nominations. Of the officers that I would
bring into the Chamber, some you may consider as
second lieutenants in the civil service, others as first
lieutenants, others as captains. And why should we
not act upon them?</p>

<p>The Senator says we had better follow the received
system. One of the finest sentiments that have fallen
from one of the most gifted of our fellow-countrymen
is that verse in which he says,&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="verse">“New occasions teach new duties.”</div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">We have a new occasion, teaching a new duty. That
new occasion is the misconduct of the Executive of the
United States; and the new duty is, that Congress
should exercise all its powers in throwing a shield over
fellow-citizens. The Executive is determined to continue
this warfare upon the incumbents of office; shall
we not, if possible, protect them? That is our duty
growing out of this hour. It may not be our duty next
year, or four years from now, as it was not our duty
last year, or four years back. But because it may not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">[Pg 244]</a></span>
be our duty next year, and was not our duty last year,
it does not follow that it is not our duty now. I would
act in the present according to the exigency; and if
there is an abuse, as no one will hesitate, I think, to
admit, I would meet it carefully, considerately, and
bravely.</p>

<p class="center">…</p>

<p>When to-morrow comes, if happily we see a clearer
sky, I shall then hearken gladly to the Senator from
Maine, and follow him in sustaining the old system;
but meanwhile the old system has ceased to be applicable.
It does not meet the case. It was good enough
when we had a President in harmony with the Senate;
but it is not good enough now. We owe it, therefore,
to ourselves, and to those looking here for protection,
to apply the remedy.</p>

<div class="medium">

<p>January 17th, after an earnest debate, Mr. Sumner spoke again.</p>

</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. President</span>,&mdash;As the proposition on which the
Senate is about to vote was brought forward by me, I
hope that I may have the indulgence of the Senate
for a few minutes. Had I succeeded in catching the
eye of the Chair at the proper time, I should, perhaps,
have said something in reply to the Senator from Indiana
[Mr. <span class="smcap">Hendricks</span>]; but he has already been answered
by the Senator from California [Mr. <span class="smcap">Conness</span>].
Besides, the topics which he introduced were political.
He did not address himself directly to the proposition
itself. I do not say that his remarks were irrelevant,
but obviously he seized the occasion to make a political
speech. The Senator is an excellent debater; he
always speaks to the point as he understands it; and
yet his point is apt to be political. Of course he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">[Pg 245]</a></span>
speaks as one having authority with his party, in
which he is an acknowledged leader. And now, Sir,
you will please to remark, he comes forward as leader
for the President of the United States. The Senator
from Indiana, an old-school Democrat,&mdash;he will not
deny the appellation,&mdash;presents himself as defender
of the President. I congratulate the President upon
so able a defender. Before this great controversy is
closed, the President will need all the ability, all the
experience, all the admirable powers of debate which
belong to the distinguished Senator.</p>

<p>As I shall recall the Senate precisely to the question,
I begin by asking the Secretary to read the amendment.</p>

<div class="medium">

<p>The Secretary read the amendment, when Mr. Sumner continued.</p>

</div>

<p>Now, Mr. President, I am unwilling to be diverted
from that plain proposition into any general discussion
of a merely political character. I ask your attention
to the simple question on which you are to vote.</p>

<p>Here I meet objections brought against the amendment,
so far as I have been able to comprehend them.
They have chiefly found voice, unless I am much mistaken,
in the Senator from Maine [Mr. <span class="smcap">Fessenden</span>],
who is as earnest as he is unquestionably able. The
Senator began with a warning, and his beginning gave
tone to all he said. He warned us not to forget the
lessons of the past; and he warned us also not to fall
under the influence of any animosity. When he warned
us not to forget the lessons of the past, such was his
earnestness that he seemed to me fresh from the study
of Confucius. No learned Chinese, anxious that there
should be no departure from the ancient ways, and filled<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">[Pg 246]</a></span>
with devotion for distant progenitors, could have enjoined
that duty more reverently. We were to follow
what had been done in the past. Now, Sir, I have a
proper deference for the past; I recognize its lessons,
and seek to comprehend them; but I am not a Chinese,
to be swathed by traditions. I break all bands
and wrappers, when the occasion requires. I trust that
the Senator will do so likewise. The present occasion
is of such a character that his lesson is entirely inapplicable.
It is well to regard the past, and study
its teachings. It is well also to regard the future,
and seek to provide for its necessities. This is plain
enough.</p>

<p>Then, Sir, we are not to act under the influence of
animosity. Excellent counsel. But, pray, what Senator,
on an occasion like this, when we strive to place in
the statutes of the country an important landmark, can
allow himself to act under such influence? Is the Senator
from Maine the only one who can claim this immunity?
I am sure he will not make exclusive claim.
As he is conscious that he is free from such disturbing
influence, so also am I. He is not more free from it
than I am. Most sincerely from my heart do I disclaim
all animosity. I have nothing of the kind. I
see nothing but my duty.</p>

<p>And when I speak of duty, I speak of what I
would emphatically call the duty of the hour. I tried
the other day, in what passed between myself and the
Senator from Maine, briefly to illustrate this idea. I
said that we are not to act absolutely with reference
to the past, nor absolutely with reference to the future,
but we are to act in the present. Each hour has its
duties, and this hour has duties such as few other hours<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">[Pg 247]</a></span>
in our history have ever presented. Is there any one
who can question it? Are we not in the midst of a
crisis? Sometimes it is said that we are in the midst
of a revolution. Call it, if you will, simply a crisis.
It is a critical hour, having its own peculiar responsibilities.
Now, if you ask me in what this present
duty specially centres, on what it specially pivots, I
have an easy reply: it is in protection to the loyal and
patriotic citizen, wherever he may be. I repeat it, protection
to the loyal and patriotic citizen is the imminent
duty of the hour. This duty is so commanding,
so engrossing, so absorbing, so peculiar,&mdash;let me say,
in one word, so sacred,&mdash;that to neglect it is like the
neglect of everything. It is nothing less than a general
abdication.</p>

<p>Such, I say emphatically, is the duty of the hour,
in presence of which it is vain for the Senator to cite
the experience of other times, when no such duty was
urgent. He does not meet the case. What he says
is irrelevant. All that was done in the past may have
been well done; for it I have no criticism; but at
this time it is absolutely inapplicable.</p>

<p>I return, then, to my proposition, that the duty of
the hour is protection to the loyal and patriotic citizen.
But when I have said this, I have not completed the
proposition. You may ask, Protection against whom?
I answer plainly, Against the President of the United
States. There, Sir, is the duty of the hour. Ponder
it well, and do not forget it. There was no such duty
on our fathers, there was no such duty on recent predecessors
in this Chamber, because there was no President
of the United States who had become the enemy
of his country.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">[Pg 248]</a></span></p>

<div class="medium">

<p>Here Mr. Sumner was called to order by Mr. McDougall, a Democratic
Senator from California, who insisted that no Senator had a
right to make use of such words in speaking of the President. Confusion
ensued, with various calls to order. There was question as
to what Mr. Sumner really said. The presiding officer [Mr. <span class="smcap">Anthony</span>,
of Rhode Island] decided that Mr. Sumner was in order, from which
decision Mr. McDougall appealed, but finally withdrew his appeal,
when Mr. Sumner continued.</p>

</div>

<p>When interrupted in the extraordinary manner witnessed
by the Senate, I was presenting reasons in favor
of the measure on which we are to vote, and I insisted
as strongly as I could that the special duty of the hour
was protection to loyal and patriotic citizens against the
President; I was replying to what fell from the Senator
from Maine, who seems, if I may judge from his
argument, to feel that there is no occasion for special
safeguard, and that the system left by our fathers is
enough. In this reply I used language which, according
to the short-hand reporter, was as follows: I read
from his notes:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“There, Sir, is the duty of the hour. There was no such
duty on our fathers, there was no such duty on our recent
predecessors, because there was no President of the United
States who had become the enemy of his country.”</p>

</div>

<p>These were my words when suddenly interrupted. By
those words, Sir, I stand.</p>

<div class="medium">

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Doolittle</span> [of Wisconsin]. I raise a question of order,
whether these words are in order, as stated by the Senator.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The Presiding Officer.</span> The Chair has already decided
a similar point of order. The Chair will submit this question
to the Senate.</p>

<p>The Presiding Officer decided that Mr. Sumner was in order. Mr.
Doolittle appealed from this decision. Debate ensued on the appeal,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">[Pg 249]</a></span>
when Mr. Lane, of Indiana, moved to lay the appeal upon the table.
Amid much confusion, other motions were interposed. At last a vote
was reached on the motion of Mr. Lane. The yeas and nays were
ordered, and, being taken, resulted,&mdash;Yeas 29, Nays 10. So the appeal
was laid upon the table. Mr. Sumner, who was in his seat,
refrained from voting. The Senate then adjourned.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>January 18th, Mr. Sumner, having the floor, continued.</p>

</div>

<p>It is only little more than a year ago that I felt it
my duty to characterize a message of the President as
“whitewashing.”<a name="FNanchor_77_77" id="FNanchor_77_77"></a><a href="#Footnote_77_77" class="fnanchor">[77]</a> The message represented the condition
of things in the Rebel States as fair and promising,
when the prevailing evidence was directly the
other way. Of course the message was “whitewashing,”
and this was a mild term for such a document.
But you do not forget how certain Senators, horror-struck
at this plainness, leaped forward to vindicate
the President. Yesterday some of these same Senators,
horror-struck again, leaped forward again in the
same task. Time has shown that I was right on the
former occasion. If anybody doubts that I was right
yesterday, I commend him to time. He will not be
obliged to wait long. Meanwhile I shall insist always
upon complete freedom of debate, and I shall exercise
it. John Milton, in his glorious aspirations, said,
“Give me the liberty to know, to utter, and to argue
freely according to conscience, above all liberties.”<a name="FNanchor_78_78" id="FNanchor_78_78"></a><a href="#Footnote_78_78" class="fnanchor">[78]</a>
Thank God, now that slave-masters are driven from this
Chamber, such is the liberty of an American Senator.
Of course there can be no citizen of a republic too high
for exposure, as there can be none too low for protection.
Exposure of the powerful, and protection of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">[Pg 250]</a></span>
weak,&mdash;these are not only invaluable liberties, but
commanding duties.</p>

<p>At last the country is opening its eyes to the actual
condition of things. Already it sees that Andrew Johnson,
who came to supreme power by a bloody incident,
has become the successor of Jefferson Davis in the spirit
by which he is ruled and in the mischief he inflicts on
his country. It sees the President of the Rebellion revived
in the President of the United States. It sees
that the violence which took the life of his illustrious
predecessor is now by his perverse complicity extending
throughout the Rebel States, making all who love
the Union its victims, and filling the land with tragedy.
It sees that the war upon faithful Unionists is still continued
under his powerful auspices, without distinction
of color, so that all, both white and black, are sacrificed.
It sees that he is the minister of discord, and not the
minister of peace. It sees, that, so long as his influence
prevails, there is small chance of tranquillity, security,
or reconciliation,&mdash;that the restoration of prosperity
in the Rebel States, so much longed for, must be
arrested,&mdash;that the business of the whole country must
be embarrassed,&mdash;and that the conditions so essential to
a sound currency must be postponed. All these things
the country observes. But indignation assumes the form
of judgment, when it is seen also that this incredible,
unparalleled, and far-reaching mischief, second only to
the Rebellion itself, of which it is a continuation, is
created, invigorated, and extended through plain usurpation.</p>

<p>I know that the President sometimes quotes the Constitution,
and professes to carry out its behests. But
this pretension is of little value. A French historian,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">[Pg 251]</a></span>
whose fame as writer is eclipsed by his greater fame
as orator, who has held important posts, and now in
advancing years is still eminent in public life, has used
words which aptly characterize an attempt like that of
the President. I quote from the History of M. Thiers,
while describing what is known as the Revolution of
the 18th Brumaire.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“When any one wishes to make a revolution, it is always
necessary to disguise the illegal as much as possible,&mdash;to
use the terms of a Constitution in order to destroy it, and
the members of a Government in order to overturn it.”<a name="FNanchor_79_79" id="FNanchor_79_79"></a><a href="#Footnote_79_79" class="fnanchor">[79]</a></p>

</div>

<p>In this spirit the President has acted. He has bent
Constitution, laws, and men to his arbitrary will, and
has even invoked the Declaration of Independence for
the overthrow of those Equal Rights it so grandly proclaims.</p>

<p>In holding up Andrew Johnson to judgment, I do
not dwell on his open exposure of himself in a condition
of intoxication, while taking the oath of office,&mdash;nor
do I dwell on the maudlin speeches by which
he has degraded the country as it was never degraded
before,&mdash;nor do I hearken to any reports of pardons
sold, or of personal corruption. This is not the
case against him, as I deem it my duty to present
it. These things are bad, very bad; but they might
not, in the opinion of some Senators, justify us on the
present occasion. In other words, they might not be
a sufficient reason for the amendment which I have
moved.</p>

<p>But there is a reason which is ample. The President
has usurped the powers of Congress on a colossal scale,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">[Pg 252]</a></span>
and has employed these usurped powers in fomenting
the Rebel spirit and kindling anew the dying fires
of the Rebellion. Though the head of the Executive,
he has rapaciously seized the powers of the Legislative,
and made himself a whole Congress, in defiance of a
cardinal principle of republican government, that each
branch must act for itself, without assuming the powers
of the other; and, in the exercise of these illegitimate
powers, he has become a terror to the good and
a support to the wicked. This is his great and unpardonable
offence, for which history must condemn
him, if you do not. He is a usurper, through whom infinite
wrong is done to his country. He is a usurper,
who, promising to be a Moses, has become a Pharaoh.
Do you ask for evidence? No witnesses are needed
to prove this guilt. It is found in public acts which
are beyond question. It is already written in the history
of our country. Absorbing to himself all the powers
of the National Government, and exclaiming, with
the French monarch, that <em>he alone</em> is “the Nation,”
he assumes, without color of law, to set up new governments
in the Rebel States, and, in the prosecution
of this palpable usurpation, places these governments
of his own creation in the hands of traitors, to the
exclusion of patriot citizens, white and black, who,
through his agency, are trampled again under the heel
of the Rebellion. Thus a power plainly illegitimate is
wielded to establish governments plainly illegitimate,
which are nothing but engines of an intolerable oppression,
under which peace and union are impossible;
and this monstrous usurpation is continued in constant
efforts by every means to enforce the recognition of
these illegitimate governments, so tyrannical in origin<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">[Pg 253]</a></span>
and so baneful in the influence they are permitted to
exert. And now, in the maintenance of this usurpation,
the President employs the power of removal from
office. Some, who would not become the partisans of
his tyranny, he has, according to his own language,
“kicked out.” Others are spared, but silenced by this
menace and the fate of their associates. Wherever
any vacancy occurs, whether in the Loyal or the Rebel
States, it is filled by the partisans of his usurpation.
Other vacancies are created to provide for these partisans.
I need not add, that, just in proportion as we
sanction such nominations or fail to arrest them, according
to the measure of our power, we become parties
to his usurpation.</p>

<p>Here I am brought directly to the practical application
of this simple statement. I have already said
that the duty of the hour is in protection to the loyal
and patriotic citizen against the President. This cannot
be doubted. The first duty of a Government is protection.
The crowning glory of a Republic is, that it leaves
no human being, however humble, without protection.
Show me a man exposed to wrong, and I show you an
occasion for the exercise of all the power that God and
the Constitution have given you. It will not do to say
that the cases are too numerous, or that the remedy
cannot be applied without interfering with a system
handed down from our fathers, or, worse still, that you
have little sympathy with this suffering. This will
not do. You must apply the remedy, or fail in duty.
Especially must you apply it, when, as now, this
wrong is part of a huge usurpation in the interest of
recent Rebellion.</p>

<p>The question, then, recurs, Are you ready to apply<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">[Pg 254]</a></span>
the remedy, according to your powers? The necessity
for this remedy may be seen in the Rebel States, and
also in the Loyal States, for the usurpation is felt in
both.</p>

<p>If you look at the Rebel States, you will see everywhere
the triumph of Presidential tyranny. There is
not a mail which does not bring letters without number
supplicating the exercise of all the powers of Congress
against the President. There is not a newspaper
which does not exhibit evidence that you are already
tardy in this work of necessity. There is not a wind
from that suffering region which is not freighted with
voices of distress. And yet you hesitate.</p>

<p>I shall not be led aside to consider the full remedy,
for it is not my habit to travel out of the strict line
of debate. Therefore I confine myself to the bill before
us, which is applicable alike to Loyal and Rebel
States.</p>

<p>This bill has its origin in what I have already
called the special duty of the hour, which is protection
of loyal and patriotic citizens against the President.
I have shown the necessity of this protection.
But the brutal language the President employs shows
the spirit in which he acts. The Senator from Indiana
[Mr. <span class="smcap">Hendricks</span>], whose judgment could not approve
this brutality, doubted if the President had used it.
Let me settle this question. Here is the “National
Intelligencer,” always indulgent to the President. In
its number for the 13th of September last it thus reports
what the Chief Magistrate said at St. Louis:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“I believe that one set of men have enjoyed the emoluments
of office long enough, and they should let another
portion of the people have a chance. [<i>Cheers.</i>] How are<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">[Pg 255]</a></span>
these men to be got out [<i>A voice, ‘Kick ’em out!’&mdash;cheers
and laughter</i>], unless your Executive can put them out,&mdash;unless
you can reach them through the President? Congress
says he shall not turn them out, and they are trying
to pass laws to prevent it being done. Well, let me say to
you, if you will stand by me in this action [<i>cheers</i>],&mdash;if
you will stand by me in trying to give the people a fair
chance,&mdash;to have soldiers and citizens to participate in
these offices,&mdash;God being willing, I will kick them out,&mdash;I
will kick them out just as fast as I can. [<i>Great cheering.</i>]”</p>

</div>

<p>Such diction as this is without example. Proceeding
from the President, it is a declaration of “policy”
which you must counteract; and in this duty make a
precedent, if need be.</p>

<p>The bill before the Senate, which the Senator from
Vermont [Mr. <span class="smcap">Edmunds</span>] has shaped with so much
care and now presses so earnestly, arises from this necessity.
Had Abraham Lincoln been spared to us, there
would have been no occasion for any such measure.
It is a bill arising from the exigency of the hour. As
such it is to be judged. But it does not meet the
whole case. Undertaking to give protection, it gives
it to a few only, instead of the many. It provides
against the removal of persons whose offices, according
to existing law and Constitution, are held by and
with the advice and consent of the Senate. Its special
object is to vindicate the power of the Senate over the
offices committed to it according to existing law and
Constitution. Thus vindicating the power of the Senate,
it does something indirectly to protect the citizen.
In this respect it is beneficent, and I shall be glad to
vote for it.</p>

<p>The amendment goes further in the same direction.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">[Pg 256]</a></span>
It provides that all agents and officers appointed by
the President or by the head of a Department, with
salaries exceeding $1,000, shall be appointed only by
and with the advice and consent of the Senate; and it
further proceeds to vacate all such appointments made
since 1st July last past, so as to arrest the recent process
of “kicking out.” The proposition is simple; and
I insist that it is necessary, unless you are willing to
leave fellow-citizens without protection against tyranny.
Really the case is so plain that I do not like to argue
it, and yet you will pardon me, if I advert to certain
objections which have been made.</p>

<p>We have been told that the number of persons it
would bring before the Senate is such that it would
clog and embarrass the public business,&mdash;in other
words, that we have not time to deal with so many
cases. This is a strange argument. Because the victims
are numerous, therefore we are to fold our hands
and let the sacrifice proceed. But I insist that just
in proportion to the number is the urgency of your
duty. Every victim has a voice; and when these voices
count by thousands, you have no right to turn away
and say, “They are too numerous for the Senate.”
This is my answer to the objection founded on numbers.</p>

<p>But this is not all. You did not shrink, during the
war, from the numerous nominations of military officers,
counting by thousands; nor did you shrink from
the numerous nominations of naval officers, counting
by thousands. The power over all these you never
relaxed, and I know well you never will relax. You
know, that, even if unable to consider carefully every
case, yet the power over them enables you to interpose<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257">[Pg 257]</a></span>
a veto on any improper nomination. The power
of the Senate is a warning against tyranny in the Executive.
But it is difficult to see any strong reason
for this power in the case of the army and navy which
is not applicable also to civil officers. This I should
say in tranquil times; but there is another reason peculiar
to the hour. Even if in tranquil times I were disposed
to leave the appointing power as it is, I am not
disposed to do so now.</p>

<p>Then, again, we are told that we must not abandon
the system of our fathers. I have already answered
this objection precisely, in saying, that, whatever may
have been the system of the Fathers, it is inadequate
to the present hour. But I am not satisfied that the
proposition moved by me is inconsistent with the system
of the Fathers. The officers of the Internal Revenue
did not exist then, and the inferior officers of the
customs were few in number and with small emoluments.
But all district attorneys and marshals, even
if their salary was no more than two hundred dollars,
were subject to the confirmation of the Senate.</p>

<div class="medium">

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Edmunds.</span> And so they are yet.</p>

</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Sumner.</span> And so they are yet. But can the
Senator doubt, that, if, at the time when those officers
were made subject to the confirmation of the Senate,
weighers and gaugers and inspectors had been as well
paid as they are now, they, too, would have been brought
under the control of this body? I cannot.</p>

<div class="medium">

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Edmunds.</span> I do not think they would.</p>

</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Sumner.</span> But even if the Senator does not accept
the view which I present on the probable course<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">[Pg 258]</a></span>
of our fathers, he cannot resist the argument, that, whatever
may have been the old system, we must act now
in the light of present duties. I repeat, a system good
for our fathers may not be good for this hour, which is
so full of danger.</p>

<p>Then, again, we are told, with something of indifference,
if not of levity, that it is not the duty of the
Senate to look after the “bread and butter” of officeholders.
This is a familiar way of saying that these
small cases are not worthy of the Senate. Not so do
I understand our duties. There is no case so small as
not to be worthy of the Senate, especially if in this
way you can save a citizen from oppression and weaken
the power of an oppressor.</p>

<p>Something has been said about the curtailment of
the Executive power, and the Senator from Maine [Mr.
<span class="smcap">Fessenden</span>] has even argued against the amendment as
conferring upon the President additional powers. This
is strange. The effect of the amendment is, by clear
intendment, to take from the President a large class
of nominations and bring them within the control of
the Senate. Thus it is obviously a curtailment of Executive
power, which I insist has become our bounden
duty. The old resolution of the House of Commons,
moved by Mr. Dunning, is applicable here: “The influence
of the Crown has increased, is increasing, and
ought to be diminished.” In this spirit we must put
a curb on the President, now maintaining illegitimate
power by removals from office.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Mr. President, I have used moderate language, strictly
applicable to the question. But it is my duty to
remind you how much the public welfare depends upon<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">[Pg 259]</a></span>
courageous counsels. Courage is now the highest wisdom.
Do not forget that we stand face to face with
an enormous and malignant usurper, through whom the
Republic is imperilled,&mdash;that Republic which, according
to our oaths of office, we are bound to save from all
harm. The lines are drawn. On one side is the President,
and on the other side is the people of the United
States. It is the old pretension of prerogative, to be
encountered, I trust, by that same inexorable determination
which once lifted England to heroic heights. The
present pretension is more outrageous, and its consequences
are more deadly; surely the resistance cannot
be less complete. An American President must not
claim an immunity denied to an English king. In the
conflict he has so madly precipitated, I am with the
people. In the President I put no trust, but in the
people I put infinite trust. Who will not stand with
the people?</p>

<p>Here, Sir, I close what I have to say at this time.
But before I take my seat, you will pardon me, if I
read a brief lesson, which seems written for the hour.
The words are as beautiful as emphatic.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“The dogmas of the quiet past are inadequate to the
stormy present. The occasion is piled high with difficulty,
and we must rise with the occasion. As our case is new,
so we must think anew and act anew. We must disenthrall
ourselves, and then we shall save our country.”</p>

</div>

<p>These are the words of Abraham Lincoln.<a name="FNanchor_80_80" id="FNanchor_80_80"></a><a href="#Footnote_80_80" class="fnanchor">[80]</a> They are
as full of vital force now as when he uttered them. I
entreat you not to neglect the lesson. Learn from its
teaching how to save our country.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">[Pg 260]</a></span></p>

<div class="medium">

<p>Mr. Edmunds and Mr. Reverdy Johnson replied. Mr. Howe, of
Wisconsin, and Mr. Lane, of Indiana, favored the amendment. Mr.
Johnson suggested that the expression of opinion adverse to the President
would disqualify a Senator to sit on his impeachment. Mr. Sumner
interrupted him to say:&mdash;</p>

</div>

<p>What right have I to know that the President is
to be impeached? How can I know it? And let me
add, even if I could know it, there can be no reason
in that why I should not argue the measure directly
before the Senate, and present such considerations as
seem to me proper, founded on the misconduct of that
officer.</p>

<div class="medium">

<p>Mr. Sumner here changed his amendment by striking out the limitation
of $1,000 and inserting $1,500. He then said:&mdash;</p>

</div>

<p>I make the change in deference to Senators about
me, and especially yielding to the earnest argument of
the Senator from Vermont [Mr. <span class="smcap">Edmunds</span>], who was so
much disturbed by the idea that the Senate would be
called to act upon inspectors. My experience teaches
me not to be disturbed at anything. I am willing to
act on an inspector or a night watchman; and if
I could, I would save him from Executive tyranny.
The Senator would leave him a prey, so far as I can
understand, for no other reason than because he is an
inspector, an officer of inferior dignity, and because,
if we embrace all inspectors, we shall have too much
to do.</p>

<p>Sir, we are sent to the Senate for work, and especially
to surround the citizen with all possible safeguards.
The duty of the hour is as I have declared.
It ought not to be postponed. Every day of postponement
is to my mind a sacrifice. Let us not, then, be
deterred even by the humble rank of these officers, or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">[Pg 261]</a></span>
by their number, but, whether humble or numerous, embrace
them within the protecting arms of the Senate.</p>

<div class="medium">

<p>The amendment was rejected,&mdash;Yeas 16, Nays 21. After further
debate, the bill passed the Senate,&mdash;Yeas 29, Nays 9. It then
passed the House with amendments. To settle the difference between
the two Houses, there was a Committee of Conference, when the bill

<p>The Senate having under consideration the bill to provide increased
revenue from imports, Mr. Edmunds, of Vermont, moved to retain the
following articles on the free list:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“Books, maps, charts, and other printed matter, specially imported in
good faith for any public library or society, incorporated or established
for philosophical, literary, or religious purposes, or for the encouragement
of the fine arts.”</p>

</div>

<p>Mr. Sumner said:&mdash;</p>

</div>

<p class="dropcap">MR. PRESIDENT,&mdash;By the existing law, public libraries
and literary societies receive books, maps,
charts, and engravings free of duty. It is now proposed
to change the law, so that public libraries and literary
societies shall no longer receive books, maps, charts,
and engravings free of duty. It is a little curious that
the present moment is seized for this important change,
which I must call retrogressive in character. It seems
like going back to the Dark Ages. We made no such
change during the war. We went through all its terrible
trials and the consequent taxation without any
such attempt. Now that peace has come, and we are
considering how to mitigate taxation, it is proposed to
add this new tax.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264">[Pg 264]</a></span></p>

<div class="medium">

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Hendricks.</span> Will the Senator allow me to ask
whether he regards this bill as a mitigation of the taxes
upon goods brought from foreign countries?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Sumner.</span> I am not discussing the bill as a general
measure.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Hendricks.</span> I thought the Senator spoke of the
present effort to mitigate taxation.</p>

</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Sumner.</span> I believe I am not wrong, when I
say there is everywhere a disposition to reduce taxation,
whether on foreign or domestic articles. Such
is the desire of the country and the irresistible tendency
of things. But what must be the astonishment,
when it appears, that, instead of reducing a tax on
knowledge, you augment it!</p>

<p>I insist, that, in imposing this duty, you not only
change the existing law, but you depart from the standing
policy of republican institutions. Everywhere we
have education at the public expense. The first form
is in the public school, open to all. But the public
library is the complement or supplement of the public
school. As well impose a tax on the public school
as on the public library.</p>

<p>I doubt if the Senate is fully aware of the number
of public libraries springing into existence. This is a
characteristic of our times. Nor is it peculiar to our
country. Down to a recent day, public libraries were
chiefly collegiate. In Europe they were collegiate or
conventual. There were no libraries of the people.
But such libraries are now appearing in England and
in France. Every considerable place or centre has its
library for the benefit of the neighborhood. But this
movement, like every liberal tendency, is more marked
in the United States. Here public libraries are coming<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_265" id="Page_265">[Pg 265]</a></span>
into being without number. The Public Library of Boston
and the Astor Library of New York are magnificent
examples, which smaller towns are emulating. In my
own State there are public libraries in Lowell, Newburyport,
New Bedford, Worcester, Springfield,&mdash;indeed, I
might almost say in every considerable town. But Massachusetts
is not alone. Public libraries are springing
up in all the Northern States. They are now extending
like a belt of light across the country. They are
a new Zodiac, in which knowledge travels with the sun
from east to west. Of course these are all for the public
good. They are public schools, where every book is a
schoolmaster. To tax such institutions now, for the first
time, is a new form of that old enemy, a “tax on knowledge.”
Such is my sense of their supreme value that I
would offer them bounties rather than taxes.</p>

<p>In continuation of this same hospitality to knowledge,
I wish to go still further, and relieve imported
books of all taxes, so far as not inconsistent with interests
already embarked in the book business. For
instance, let all books, maps, charts, and engravings
printed before 1840 take their place on the free list.
Publications before that time cannot come in competition
with any interests here. The revenue they afford
will be unimportant. The tax you impose adds to the
burdens of scholars and professional men who need
them. And yet every one of these books, when once
imported, is a positive advantage to the country, by
which knowledge is extended and the public taste improved.
I would not claim too much for these instructive
strangers belonging to another generation. I think
I do not err in asking for them a generous welcome.
But, above all, do not tax them.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266">[Pg 266]</a></span></p>

<p>It is sometimes said that we tax food and clothes,
therefore we must tax books. I regret that food or
clothes are taxed, because the tax presses upon the
poor. But this is no reason for any additional tax.
Reduce all such taxes, rather than add to them. But
you will not fail to remember the essential difference
between these taxes. In New England education from
the beginning was at the public expense; and this has
been for some time substantially the policy of the whole
country, except so far as it was darkened by Slavery.
Therefore I insist, that, because we tax food and clothes
for the body, this is no reason why we should tax food
and clothes for the mind.</p>

<div class="medium">

<p>The question, being taken by yeas and nays, resulted,&mdash;Yeas 22,
Nays 13; so the amendment was adopted.</p>

<p>Mr. Sumner then moved to exempt “maps, charts, and engravings
executed prior to 1840.” He said that this amendment was naturally
associated with that on which the Senate had just acted; that there
could be no competition with anything at home.</p>

<p>In reply to Mr. Williams, of Oregon, Mr. Sumner again spoke.</p>

</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. President</span>,&mdash;There is no question of the exemption
of those who are best able to pay these duties;
it is simply a question of a tax on knowledge. The
Senator by his system would shut these out from the
country, and would say, “Hail to darkness!” I do
not wish to repeat what I have so often said; but the
argument of the Senator has been made here again and
again, and heretofore, as often as made, I have undertaken
to answer it. He says we put a tax on necessaries
now,&mdash;on the food that fills the body, on the
garments that clothe the body. I regret that we do.
I wish we were in a condition to relieve the country
of such taxation. But does not the Senator bear in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267">[Pg 267]</a></span>
mind that he proposes to go further, and to depart
from the great principle governing our institutions from
the beginning of our history? We have had education
free: in other words, we have undertaken to fill the
mind and to clothe the mind at the public expense.
We never did undertake to fill the body or to clothe
the body at the public expense. Sir, as a lover of my
race, I should be glad, could the country have clothed
the body and filled the body at the public expense.
I should be glad, had society been in such a condition
that this vision could be accomplished; but we all
know that it is not, and I content myself with something
much simpler and more practical. I would aim
to establish the principle which seems to have governed
our fathers, and which is so congenial with republican
institutions, that education and knowledge, so far as
practicable, shall be free.</p>

<p>To make education and knowledge free, you must,
so far as possible, relieve all books from taxation. I
have already said that I did not propose to interfere
with any of the practical interests of the book trade;
but, where those interests are out of the way, I insist
that the great principle of republican institutions
should be applied. This is my answer to the Senator
from Oregon. I fear he has not adequately considered
the question. He has not brought to it that
knowledge, that judgment, which always command my
respect, as often as he addresses the Senate. He seems
to have spoken hastily. I hope that he will withdraw,
or at least relax, his opposition, and, revolving
the subject hereafter, range himself, as he must, with
his large intelligence, on the side of human knowledge.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268">[Pg 268]</a></span></p>

<div class="medium">

<p>Then, again, in reply to Mr. Conness, of California, Mr. Sumner remarked:&mdash;</p>

</div>

<p>It is because I hearken to the needs of my country
that I make this proposition. I am not to be led aside
by the picture of other necessities. I respect all the
necessities of the people; but among the foremost are
those of public instruction, and it is of those I am a
humble representative on this floor. The Senator from
California may, if he chooses, treat that representation
with levity; he may announce himself an opponent of
the policy which I would establish for my country;
he may set himself against what I insist is a fundamental
principle of republican institutions, that knowledge
should not be taxed; he may go forth and ask
for taxation on books and on public libraries, and, if
he chooses, carry the principle still further, and tax
the public school. He will then be consistent with
himself. I hope that he will allow me to speak for
what I believe the true need of the country.</p>

<div class="medium">

<p>The motion to exempt maps, charts, and engravings was rejected.</p>

<p>Mr. Sumner then moved to place on the free list “books printed
prior to 1840.” It being objected, that “the duty as already laid was
very low, only 15 per cent.,”&mdash;that “we have to look to revenue,”&mdash;and
that it was desirable “to have all the interests of the country
taxed,”&mdash;Mr. Sumner replied:&mdash;</p>

</div>

<p>Every argument for making the duty low is equally
strong against having any duty on the subject. There
is no reason that could have influenced the Committee
in favor of reducing the duty which is not equally
strong in favor of removing the duty. The Senator
declares that the object is revenue. But the revenue
that will come from this source is very small; it is not
large enough to compensate for the mischief it will<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269">[Pg 269]</a></span>
cause. Sir, I believe all the conclusions of the best experienced
in taxation are, that we should seek as much
as possible to diminish the objects of taxation. Just in
proportion as nations become experienced in imposing
taxes do they limit the objects to which the taxes are
applied. It seems to me we are strangely insensible to
that lesson of history. We seem to be groping about
and seizing hold of every little object, every filament, if
I may so express myself, which we can grasp, in order
to drag it into the sphere of taxation.</p>

<p>I think we should be better employed, if we declined
to tax a large number of articles which it is proposed to
tax, and brought our taxation to bear on a few important
articles, which we should make contribute substantially
to the resources of the country. The tax that is
now proposed will contribute nothing of any real substance
to the resources of the country, while to my view
it is not creditable. I say it frankly, it is not creditable
to the civilization of our age, and least of all is it creditable
to the civilization of a republic.</p>

<p>Such is my conviction. As often as I have thought
of this question, I cannot see it in any other light;
and I do think that money derived from a tax on
books can be vindicated only on the principle of the
Roman emperor, “Money from any quarter, no matter
what, for money does not smell.”<a name="FNanchor_82_82" id="FNanchor_82_82"></a><a href="#Footnote_82_82" class="fnanchor">[82]</a> Now it were better,
if, instead of hunting up these several articles for taxation,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270">[Pg 270]</a></span>
running them down like game, to bag them in
the public treasury, we should confine ourselves to the
great subjects, and make them productive. There are
enough of them, and in this way we can have revenue
enough. I would have all the revenue we want; but,
having it, be hospitable to literature, to knowledge, to
art; and now let me say, be hospitable to books, because
through books you will obtain what you desire
in literature, in knowledge, and in art.</p>

<div class="medium">

<p>Mr. Kirkwood, of Iowa, thought Mr. Sumner ought to be content
with what was done. “If he gets the rate reduced from 25 to 15 per
cent., when the taxes on everything we eat and wear are being raised
20, 30, 40, or 50 per cent., I think that he ought to be content.”</p>

</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Sumner.</span> Personally I am content with anything.
I am trying to do what I think best for the
people. I may be mistaken in my judgment; and
when I see so many distinguished Senators so earnestly
differing from me, I am led to call in question
my conclusions; and yet considerable reflection and
some experience in dealing with this question have
always brought me more strongly than before to the
same unalterable conclusion. I feel, that, in imposing
this tax, you make a great mistake; because it is
a bad example, and just to the extent of its influence
keeps knowledge out of the country.</p>

<div class="medium">

<p>The motion of Mr. Sumner was rejected,&mdash;Yeas 5, Nays 32.

philosophical apparatus imported for societies, shared the same fate.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/line.png" width="80" height="16" alt="" />
</div>

<div class="medium">

<p>January 29th, the Senate having under consideration the bill to
provide increased revenue from imports, known as the Tariff Bill,
Mr. Sumner moved the following:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“On all bituminous coal mined and imported from any place not more
than thirty degrees of longitude east of Washington, fifty cents per ton of
twenty-eight bushels, eighty pounds to the bushel.”</p>

</div>

<p>The effect of this amendment would be to reduce the duty from $1.50
to 50 cents a ton.</p>

</div>

<p class="dropcap">MR. PRESIDENT,&mdash;The object of the amendment
is to bring the bill back where it was at first.
The Senate will remember that in committee a motion
prevailed by which the duty of 50 cents per ton on
the coal mentioned was raised to $1.50. I am at a
loss to understand the precise object of this increased
tax on coal. There are strong reasons against any tax
on coal; and the reasons are stronger still against this
increased tax. Its movers must have an object. What
is it?</p>

<p>It seems that there are imported into the United
States about 500,000 tons, being 350,000 from the British
Provinces and 150,000 from Great Britain; and this
coal is to be taxed at the rate of $1.50 a ton in gold.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_272" id="Page_272">[Pg 272]</a></span>
If the same amount of importation continued, this tax
would yield $750,000 in gold,&mdash;a handsome addition
to the revenue. But I am sure the tax is not imposed
on this account. It is imposed with some vague
hope of benefit to the coal interest. But here, as we
look at it, we are mystified. Is it supposed that the
price of coal throughout the country will be raised to
this extent? The idea is monstrous. There are some
22,000,000 tons now produced, which, if raised in price
according to this tax, will cost the country 33,000,000
gold dollars in addition to the present price. This
might be advantageous to certain proprietors, but it
must be damaging to the country. Nobody can expect
this. The object, then, is something else. I will
not say that it is merely to take advantage of the
States that do not produce coal, for this would be
sheer oppression. I suppose that it must be to exclude
foreign coal, and to that extent open the market
for domestic coal.</p>

<p>But this tax will be positively oppressive to coal-purchasers
in New England, to say nothing of New
York. Nature has denied coal to this region of country,&mdash;or
rather, Nature has placed the natural supply
for this region outside our political jurisdiction. It
is in Nova Scotia, on the other side of our boundary
line. Coal in abundance is there, easily accessible by
water, and therefore transported at comparatively small
cost. Another part of our country has a different supply.
On the other side of the mountain-ridge separating
the sea-coast from the valleys of the West is an
infinite coal-field, the source of untold wealth, which,
beginning in the mountains and filling West Virginia
and Western Pennsylvania, stretches through the valley<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_273" id="Page_273">[Pg 273]</a></span>
of the Ohio, enriching the States that border upon
it, and then, crossing the Mississippi, extends through
other States beyond, even to Colorado. This is the
greatest coal-field, as it is also the greatest corn-field,
in the world. It is magnificent beyond comparison.
This is the natural resource for the immense region
west of the Alleghanies. But why should New England,
which has a natural resource comparatively near
at home, be compelled at great sacrifice to drag her
coal from these distant supplies?</p>

<p>I hear of complaint at Pittsburg, where the price of
coal is only two dollars a ton, currency. But imported
coal in New England costs at the mine two dollars a
ton, gold. Add three or four dollars a ton for freight.
And now it is proposed to pile on this a duty of more
than two dollars, currency. If Pittsburg complains of
coal at two dollars a ton, what must Boston say, when
you make it nine dollars? Is this just? Is it practically
wise? But I forget: there can be no wisdom
without justice.</p>

<p>If it be said that the interests of New England are
protected even by the bill before the Senate, I have
to say in reply, that no interest of hers is protected
at the expense of the rest of the country. All that
we ask is fair play. Let it be shown that there is
any part of the country which will suffer from the
favor accorded to New England as her coal-purchasers
must suffer from the favor accorded to the distant coal-owners
of the mountains, and I will do what I can to
see justice done. I ask nothing but that justice which
I am always willing to accord. We constitute parts
of one country with common interests, and the prosperity
of each is bound up in the prosperity of all.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_274" id="Page_274">[Pg 274]</a></span></p>

<p>It is said that this proposed tax will be of advantage
to the Cumberland coal in the mountains of
Maryland. Perhaps; but not to any considerable extent.
I understand that not more than 60,000 tons
of Nova Scotia coal are imported in competition with
that of Cumberland. This is mainly at Providence,
where it is used in the manufacture of iron. But the
Cumberland coal is so completely adapted to glassworks,
railways, ocean steamships, blacksmiths’ forges,
that it may be said to command the market exclusively.
Nature has given to it this monopoly. Why
not be content?</p>

<p>There are peculiar reasons why coal should be cheap,
whether viewed as a necessary or as a motive power.
As a necessary, it enters into the comforts of life; as
a motive power, it is the substitute for water-power.
What reason can you give for a tax on motive power
from coal which is not equally strong for a tax on
motive power from water, unless it be that one is
“black” and the other is “white”? I plead that you
shall not needlessly add to the public burden in a particular
portion of the country. I have alluded to the
cheapness of coal at Pittsburg. In other places it is
cheaper still. At Pomeroy, in Ohio, it is $1.40 a ton,
and at Cumberland itself it is $1.50 a ton, always currency;
and yet New England is to pay $1.50 tax, gold,
being more than the coal is worth to its producer, besides
the large cost of transportation.</p>

<p>Next after the industry of a people is cheap coal,
as an element of national prosperity. Without it, even
industry will lose much of its activity and variety. It
is coal that has vitalized and quickened all the mighty
energies of England. From coal have come all the various<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_275" id="Page_275">[Pg 275]</a></span>
products of her manufactories, and these again have
furnished the freights for her ships, so that she has become
not only a great manufacturing nation, but also a
great commercial nation. Coal is the author of all this.
Coal is the fuel under the British pot which makes it
boil. It ought to do the same for us, and even more,
if you will let it. Therefore I end as I began,&mdash;tax
coal as little as possible.</p>

<div class="medium">

<p>In reply especially to Mr. Reverdy Johnson, of Maryland, and Mr.
Sherman, of Ohio, Mr. Sumner said:&mdash;</p>

</div>

<p class="center">…</p>

<p>Now, without following the Senator from Kentucky
[Mr. <span class="smcap">Davis</span>] in that proposition, I do insist, that, on
articles of prime necessity, we should reduce taxation
where we can. Therefore, when the Senator from Ohio
tells me, that, if my proposition is adopted, we shall lose
a certain amount of revenue derived from coal, I have
an easy reply. Very well,&mdash;let us lose that amount of
revenue derived from coal. You ought not to obtain
it; coal ought not to be one of your taxed articles. So
far as possible, coal should be cheap. That is the proposition
with which I began and ended; and if I do not
impress that upon the Senate, I certainly fail in what
I attempted.</p>

<div class="medium">

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Grimes</span> [of Iowa]. Why should it be cheap?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Sumner.</span> Because it enters into the necessaries of
life, and because it is a motive power that works our manufactories.</p>

</div>

<p class="center">…</p>

<p>I say that the article is necessary to us in New
England. It enters into our daily life,&mdash;into the economies
of every house, into the expenses of every citizen.
It enters, therefore, into the welfare of the community;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_276" id="Page_276">[Pg 276]</a></span>
and you cannot tax coal without making the
whole community feel it, whether rich or poor. Every
poor man feels it. If I said the rich man felt it, you
would reply, “That makes no difference; let him feel
it.” I insist that every poor man feels it; and I insist
further, that all who are interested in the manufactures
of the country necessarily feel it,&mdash;not only
producers and owners, but all who use the products of
their looms. I say, that, as a motive power, it should
be made cheap and kept cheap. Now the apparent
policy is, to make it dear and keep it dear.</p>

<div class="medium">

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Hendricks</span> [of Indiana]. I like the Senator’s argument
just where he is now; but I wish to ask him whether,
if by a tariff you raise the price of every yard of cheap woollen
goods and cheap cotton goods, it is not a direct tax on
the labor of the poor man of the West, who has to buy
them?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Creswell</span> [of Maryland, to Mr. Sumner]. That is
the application of your argument.</p>

</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Sumner.</span> The Senator from Maryland says that
is the application of my argument. Pardon me, not at
all; because the tax on cotton and on woollen goods&mdash;I
have had very little to do with imposing any such
tax&mdash;is not oppressive on any part of the country,
nor does it bear hard on the constituents of the Senator,
or on the constituents of any Senator on this floor;
whereas the increase of the tax on coal will bear hard
upon a whole community, and upon all its interests; and
that is the precise difference between the two cases.</p>

<p>The Senator from Ohio seemed to speak of this with
perfect tranquillity, as if there were nothing in it oppressive,
or even open to criticism. He thought we
might tax coal as we tax any other article. I differ<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_277" id="Page_277">[Pg 277]</a></span>
from him. I do not think you should tax coal as you
tax other articles; and, further, I do not think you
should impose any tax bearing with special hardship,
so as to be something akin to injustice, on any particular
part of our country. That is my answer to the
argument of the Senator from Maryland, and to the inquiry
of the Senator from Indiana.</p>

<div class="medium">

<p>Mr. Creswell replied warmly, criticizing Mr. Sumner, saying, among
other things,&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“The distinguished Senator from Massachusetts has treated us to a
Free-Trade speech in the Senate of the United States. The commentary
of the Senator from Indiana was just and correct; it was a deduction that
he had a right logically to make; and I tell the Senator from Massachusetts
that his course in the Senate to-day is in its effects a better Free-Trade
speech than has ever been made in any of the Middle States during
the last ten years.”</p>

<div class="medium">

<p>The Senate had under consideration an Amendment to the National
Constitution, reported by the Judiciary Committee, as follows:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“No person elected President or Vice-President, who has once served as
President, shall afterward be eligible to either office.”</p>

</div>

<p>Mr. Fessenden, of Maine, thought that the words “who has once
served as President” should be struck out. Mr. Williams, of Oregon,
suggested: “No person who has once served as President shall afterward
be eligible to either office.” Mr. Poland, of Vermont, moved,
as a substitute, the following:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“The President and Vice-President of the United States shall hereafter
be chosen for the term of six years; and no person elected President or
Vice-President, who has once served as President, shall afterward be eligible
to either office.”</p>

</div>

<p>Mr. Sumner said:&mdash;</p>

</div>

<p class="dropcap">I agree with the Senator from Maryland [Mr.
<span class="smcap">Johnson</span>], so far as I was able to follow his remarks.
It seems to me it would be better, if the term of the
President were six years rather than four. I regretted
that the report of the Committee did not embody such
a change. I am therefore thankful to the Senator from
Vermont, who by his motion gives us an opportunity
to vote on that proposition.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_279" id="Page_279">[Pg 279]</a></span></p>

<p>But allow me to go a little further, and there I
should like the attention of my friend opposite [Mr.
<span class="smcap">Johnson</span>]. If the term of the President is to be six
years, should we not abolish the office of Vice-President?
Are you willing to take the chance of a Vice-President
becoming President a few weeks after the
beginning of the six years’ term, and then serving out
that full term? We all know, in fact, that the Vice-President
is nominated often as a sort of balance to
the President. It is too much with a view to certain
political considerations, and possibly to aid the election
of the President, rather than to secure the services
of one in all respects competent to be President. Suppose,
therefore, we have a President only, and leave to
Congress the provision for a temporary filling of the
office, as now on the disability of the President and
Vice-President.</p>

<p>I throw out these views without making any motion.
I submit that we do not meet all the difficulties
of the present hour, unless we go still further and provide
against abnormal troubles from the nomination of
a Vice-President selected less with reference to fitness
than to transient political considerations. As my
friend says, he is thrown in for a make-weight, and
then, in the providence of God, the make-weight becomes
Chief Magistrate. It seems to me important,
that, if possible, we should provide against the recurrence
of such difficulties.</p>

<p>But suppose the proposition of the Committee to
stand as reported, I am brought then to the question
raised by the Senator from Maine [Mr. <span class="smcap">Fessenden</span>],
whether it should be applicable to a Vice-President
in the providence of God called to be President. On<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_280" id="Page_280">[Pg 280]</a></span>
that point I am obliged to go with the Committee.
It seems to me that the evil we wish to guard against
in the case of the President naturally arises in the
case of a Vice-President who becomes President. I
say this on the reason of the case, and then I say it
on our melancholy experience. The three cases in our
history which distinctly teach the necessity of the
Amendment before us are of three Vice-Presidents who
in the providence of God became Presidents. But for
these three cases, nobody would have thought of change.
It is to meet the difficulties found to arise from a Vice-President
becoming President, and then hearkening to
the whisperings and temptations which unhappily visit
a person in his situation, that we have been led to contemplate
the necessity of change. I hope, therefore,
if the proposition of the Senator from Vermont [Mr.
<span class="smcap">Poland</span>] is not taken as a substitute, that the words
of the Committee will be preserved.</p>

<p>I am disposed to go still further. I would have an
additional Amendment,&mdash;one that has not appeared in
this discussion, though not unknown in this Chamber,
for distinguished Senators who once occupied these
seats have more than once advocated it,&mdash;I mean an
Amendment providing for the election of President directly
by the people, without the intervention of Electoral
Colleges. Such an Amendment would give every
individual voter, wherever he might be, a positive
weight in the election. It would give minorities in
distant States an opportunity of being heard in determining
who shall be Chief Magistrate. Now they
are of no consequence. Such an Amendment would
be of peculiar value. It would be in harmony, too,
with those ideas, belonging to the hour, of the unity<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_281" id="Page_281">[Pg 281]</a></span>
of the Republic. I know nothing that would contribute
more to bring all the people, to mass all the people,
into one united whole, than to make the President
directly eligible by their votes. But no such proposition
is before us, nor is there any such proposition as
I have alluded to with regard to the office of Vice-President.
I hope, however, that these subjects will
not be allowed to pass out of mind, and that some
time or other we shall be able to act on them in a
practical way.</p>

<div class="medium">

<p>The subject of Reconstruction was uppermost during the present
session, sometimes in Constitutional Amendments and sometimes in
measures of legislation.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>February 13th, the Senate received from the House of Representatives
a bill “to provide for the more efficient government of the Insurrectionary
States,” which, after various changes, was finally passed
under the title of “An Act to provide for the more efficient government
of the Rebel States,” being the most important measure of
legislation in the history of Reconstruction. As this bill came from
the House it was a military bill, creating five military districts in the
South, without any requirement with regard to suffrage, and with no
exclusion of Rebels. Mr. Bingham, of Ohio, and Mr. Blaine, of Maine,
announced in the House amendments requiring in the new constitutions
“that the elective franchise shall be enjoyed by all male citizens
of the United States twenty-one years old and upward, without
regard to race, color, or previous condition of servitude, except such
as may be disfranchised for participating in the late Rebellion or
for felony at Common Law.” But they had not been able to obtain a
direct vote; nor was there any exclusion of Rebels in their propositions.
Mr. Stevens, of Pennsylvania, said:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“The amendment of the gentleman from Maine [Mr. <span class="smcap">Blaine</span>] lets in
a vast number of Rebels and shuts out nobody. All I ask is, that, when
the House comes to vote upon that amendment, it shall understand that
the adoption of it would be an entire surrender of those States into the
hands of the Rebels.”</p>

</div>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_283" id="Page_283">[Pg 283]</a></span></p>
<p>About this time the House passed what was known as the Louisiana
Bill, being a bill providing for the reconstruction of that State,
with all necessary machinery, not unlike the bill introduced on the
first day of the preceding session, “to enforce the guaranty of a republican
form of government in certain States whose governments have
been usurped or overthrown.”<a name="FNanchor_83_83" id="FNanchor_83_83"></a><a href="#Footnote_83_83" class="fnanchor">[83]</a> The two bills together would have
made a complete system of Protection, and the second, when extended
to all the States, a complete system of Reconstruction.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>February 14th, Mr. Sumner said:&mdash;</p>

</div>

<p class="dropcap">I am in favor of each of these bills. Each is excellent.
One is the beginning of a true Reconstruction;
the other is the beginning of a true Protection.
Now in these Rebel States there must be
Reconstruction and there must be Protection. Both
must be had, and neither should be antagonized with
the other. The two should go on side by side,&mdash;guardian
angels of the Republic. Never was Congress
called to consider measures of more vital importance.
I am unwilling to discriminate between the two. I
accept them both with all my heart, and am here now
to sustain them by my constant presence and vote.</p>

<p>But, Sir, what we know as the Louisiana Bill came
into this Chamber first; it was first made familiar to
us; it has precedence. On that account it seems to
me it ought to come up first, it ought to lead the way.
I am not going to say that this is better than the other,
or that the other is better than this. Each is good; and
yet, I doubt not, each is susceptible of amendment. The
Senator from Maine [Mr. <span class="smcap">Fessenden</span>] has already foreshadowed
an important amendment on the bill reported
by the Committee of which he is Chairman; I have
already sent to the Chair an amendment which at the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_284" id="Page_284">[Pg 284]</a></span>
proper time I may move on the other bill. But I desire
to make one remark with regard to amendments.
I am so much in earnest for the passage of these bills,
that I shall cheerfully forego any amendment of my
own, if I find it to be the general sentiment of those
truly in earnest for the bills that we ought not to attempt
amendments. If, however, amendments seem to
be preferable, then I shall propose those I have sent to
the Chair.</p>

<div class="medium">

<p>February 15th, the Senate began the consideration of the Military
Bill, continuing in session until three o’clock in the morning of the
next day. Speeches and motions showed great differences on the subject.
Some were content with a purely military bill, contemplating
simply the protection of the people in the Rebel States. Others wished
to add measures of Reconstruction; and here again there were differences.
Some were content with the requirement of suffrage without
distinction of color in the new constitutions, making no provision for
the exclusion of Rebels, leaving the organization in the hands of the
existing electors, and providing, that, on the adoption of the Constitutional
Amendment, and of a State constitution securing equal suffrage,
any such State should be entitled to representation in Congress.</p>

<p>In the hope of putting an end to these differences, a caucus of
Republican Senators was held the next forenoon, when a committee
was appointed, as follows: Mr. Sherman, of Ohio, Mr. Fessenden, of
Maine, Mr. Howard, of Michigan, Mr. Harris, of New York, Mr. Frelinghuysen,
of New Jersey, Mr. Trumbull, of Illinois, and Mr. Sumner,
to consider the pending bill and amendments and report to the
caucus. The committee withdrew from the Senate, leaving a Senator
making a long and elaborate speech, and proceeded with their work.
The House bill was taken as the basis, and amended in several particulars,
to which Mr. Sumner afterwards alluded in the Senate. An
effort by Mr. Sumner to require equal suffrage found no favor; nor
did what was known as the Louisiana Bill, which he proposed as a
substitute; nor an effort to exclude Rebels. He felt it his duty to
say to the committee, that, on the making of the report, he should
appeal to the caucus, which he did. The caucus, by 15 Yeas to 13
Nays,&mdash;Senators standing to be counted,&mdash;voted to require equal
suffrage in the choice of the constitutional conventions; also in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_285" id="Page_285">[Pg 285]</a></span>
new constitutions, and in their ratification. But the bill was left
without any exclusion of Rebels, and with the declaration, that, doing
these things and ratifying the Amendment to the National Constitution,
a State should be entitled to representation in Congress. In these
latter respects it seemed to Mr. Sumner highly objectionable.</p>

<p>The vote of the caucus to require suffrage without distinction of
color seemed a definitive settlement of that question for the Rebel
States. At that small meeting, and by those informal proceedings,
this great act was accomplished. For Mr. Sumner it was an occasion
of especial satisfaction, as his long-continued effort was crowned
with success. These volumes show how, by letter, speech, resolution,
and bill, he had constantly maintained this duty of Congress. His
bill, introduced on the first day of the preceding session, “to enforce
the guaranty of a republican form of government in certain States
whose governments have been usurped or overthrown,” contained the
specific requirement now adopted, while the debates on the Louisiana
Bill,<a name="FNanchor_84_84" id="FNanchor_84_84"></a><a href="#Footnote_84_84" class="fnanchor">[84]</a> the Colorado Bill,<a name="FNanchor_85_85" id="FNanchor_85_85"></a><a href="#Footnote_85_85" class="fnanchor">[85]</a> the Nebraska Bill,<a name="FNanchor_86_86" id="FNanchor_86_86"></a><a href="#Footnote_86_86" class="fnanchor">[86]</a> and the Constitutional
Amendment,<a name="FNanchor_87_87" id="FNanchor_87_87"></a><a href="#Footnote_87_87" class="fnanchor">[87]</a> attested his endeavor to apply this requirement.</p>

<p>During the evening session, Mr. Sherman, chairman of the caucus
committee, moved the bill accepted by the caucus, as a substitute for
the House bill. It was understood that it would receive the support
of the Republican Senators without further amendment, and, as they
constituted a large majority, its passage was sure. Under these circumstances,
Mr. Sumner left the Chamber at midnight. The vote was
taken a little after six o’clock, Sunday morning,&mdash;Yeas 29, Nays 10.</p>

<p>In the other House, the substitute of the Senate was the occasion of
decided differences, not unlike those in the Senate on the House bill.
Many felt that the Unionists were left without adequate protection.
Mr. Stevens, of Pennsylvania, after saying that the Senate had sent
“an amendment which contains everything else but protection,” exclaimed:
“Pass this bill and you open the flood-gates of misery,&mdash;you
disgrace, in my judgment, the Congress of the United States.” Mr.
Boutwell, of Massachusetts, said: “My objection to the proposed substitute
of the Senate is fundamental, it is conclusive. It provides, if
not in terms, at least in fact, by the measures which it proposes, to
reconstruct those State governments at once through the agency of
disloyal men.” Mr. Williams, of Pennsylvania, said: “We sent to
the Senate a proposition to meet the necessities of the hour, which was
Protection without Reconstruction, and it sends back another, which is
Reconstruction without Protection.” At length, on motion of Mr. Stevens,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_286" id="Page_286">[Pg 286]</a></span>
the House refused to concur in the amendment of the Senate,
and asked a committee of conference on the disagreeing votes of the
two Houses.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>February 19th, the excitement of the House was again transferred
to the Senate, where Mr. Williams, of Oregon, moved that the Senate
insist upon its amendment, and agree to the conference. An
earnest debate ensued, in which Mr. Sumner favored the conference
committee, and also explained what he wished to accomplish by the
bill. Mr. Williams withdrew his motion, when Mr. Sherman moved
that the Senate insist on its amendment to the House bill and that
the House be informed thereof. Mr. Trumbull sustained the motion.
Mr. Sumner followed.</p>

</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. President</span>,&mdash;In what the Senator from Illinois
[Mr. <span class="smcap">Trumbull</span>] has said of the failure by the President
to discharge his duties under existing laws I entirely
agree. He touches the case to the quick. It is
impossible not to see that the special difficulty of the
present moment springs from the bad man who sits
in the executive chair. He is the centre of our woes.
More than once before I have recalled the saying of
Catholic Europe, “All roads lead to Rome.” So now,
among us, do all roads lead to the President. We attempt
nothing which does not bring us face to face with
him, precisely as during the Rebellion we attempted
nothing which did not bring us face to face with Jefferson
Davis. I mention this, not to deter, but for encouragement.
We have already conquered the chief
of the Rebellion. I doubt not that we shall conquer
his successor also. But this can be only by strenuous
exertion. It is no argument against legislation that the
President will not execute it. We must do our duty,
and insist always that he shall do his.</p>

<p>Therefore I am in favor of some measure of Reconstruction,
the best we can secure, the more thorough<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_287" id="Page_287">[Pg 287]</a></span>
the better. And I ask you to take such steps as will
best accomplish this result. There is a difference between
the two Houses, and at this stage the customary
proceeding is a conference committee. But the Senator
from Illinois is against any such committee in a case of
such magnitude. To my mind his argument should be
directed against the rule of Parliamentary Law which
provides a conference committee at this precise stage
of parliamentary proceedings. Let him move to change
the Parliamentary Law, so that in cases of peculiar importance
the common rule shall cease to be applicable.
Let this be his thesis. But, so long as the <i>Lex Parliamentaria</i>
exists, I submit that it is hardly reasonable
to resist its application, especially when the House has
asked a conference committee on a bill of theirs which
you have amended.</p>

<p class="center">…</p>

<p>I differ from the Senator [Mr. <span class="smcap">Sherman</span>, of Ohio]
radically, when he intimates that the bill needs only
“slight” amendments. With this opinion I can understand
that he should urge a course which I fear may
cut off amendments to me essential.</p>

<p>Mr. President, I would speak frankly of this measure,
which has in it so much of good and so much of evil.
Rarely have good and evil been mixed on such a scale.
Look at the good, and you are full of grateful admiration.
Look at the evil, and you are impatient at such
an abandonment of duty. Much is gained, but much is
abandoned. You have done much, but you have not
done enough. You have left undone things which
ought to be done. The Senator from Maine [Mr. <span class="smcap">Fessenden</span>]
was right in asking more. I agree with him.
I ask more. All the good of the bill cannot make me<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_288" id="Page_288">[Pg 288]</a></span>
forget its evil. It is very defective. It is horribly defective.
Too strong language cannot be used in characterizing
a measure with such fatal defects. But nobody
recognizes more cordially than myself the good it
has. Pardon me, if I do my best to make it better.</p>

<p>This is the original House bill for the military government
of the Rebel States, revised and amended by
the Senate in essential particulars. As it came from
the House it was excellent in general purpose, but imperfect.
It was nothing but a military bill, providing
protection for fellow-citizens in the Rebel States. Unquestionably
it was improved in the Senate. It is easy
to mention its good points, for these are conspicuous
and seem like so many monuments.</p>

<p>Throughout the bill, in its title, in its preamble, and
then again in its body, the States in question are designated
as “Rebel States.” I like the designation. It
is brief and just. It seems to justify on the face any
measure of precaution or security. It teaches the country
how these States are to be regarded for the present.
It teaches these States how they are regarded by Congress.
“Rebel States”: I like the term, and I am
glad it is repeated. God grant that the time may come
when this term may be forgotten! but until then we
must not hesitate to call things by their right names.</p>

<p>More important still is the declaration in the preamble,
that “no legal State governments” now exist in
the enumerated Rebel States. This is a declaration of
incalculable value. For a long time, too long, we have
hesitated; but at last this point is reached, destined
to be “the initial point” of a just Reconstruction. For
a long time, again and again, I have insisted that those
governments are <em>illegal</em>. Strangely, you would not say<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_289" id="Page_289">[Pg 289]</a></span>
so. The present bill fixes this starting-point of a true
policy. If the existing governments are “illegal,” you
have duties with regard to them which cannot be postponed.
You cannot stop with this declaration. You
must see that it is carried out in a practical manner.
In other words, you must brush away these illegal governments,
the spawn of Presidential usurpation, and
supply their places. The illegal must give place to the
legal; and Congress must supervise and control the
transition. The bill has a special value in the obligations
it imposes upon Congress. Let it find a place
in the statute-book, and your duties will be fixed beyond
recall.</p>

<p>Another point is established which in itself is a prodigious
triumph. As I mention it, I cannot conceal
my joy. It is the direct requirement of universal suffrage,
without distinction of race or color. This is done
by Act of Congress, without Constitutional Amendment.
It is a grand and beneficent exercise of existing powers,
for a long time invoked, but now at last grasped. No
Rebel State can enjoy representation in Congress, until
it has conferred the suffrage upon all its citizens, and
fixed this right in its constitution. This is the Magna
Charta you are about to enact. Since Runnymede,
there has been nothing of greater value to Human
Rights.</p>

<p>To this enumeration add that the bill is in its general
purposes a measure of protection for loyal fellow-citizens
trodden down by Rebels. To this end, the military
power is set in motion, and the whole Rebel region is
divided into districts where the strong arm of the soldier
is to supply the protection asked in vain from
illegal governments.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_290" id="Page_290">[Pg 290]</a></span></p>

<p>Look now at the other side, and you will see the
defects. By an amendment of the Senate, the House
bill, which was merely a military bill for protection,
has been converted into a measure of Reconstruction.
But it is Reconstruction without machinery or motive
power. There is no provision for the initiation of new
governments. There is no helping hand extended to
the loyal people seeking to lay anew the foundations of
civil order. They are left to grope in the dark. This
is not right. It is a failure on the part of Congress,
which ought to preside over Reconstruction and lend
its helping hand, by securing Education and Equal
Rights to begin at once, and by appointing the way and
the season in which good citizens should proceed in
creating the new governments.</p>

<p>I cannot forget, also, that there is no provision by
which the freedmen can be secured a freehold for themselves
and their families, which has always seemed to
me most important in Reconstruction.</p>

<p>But all this, though of the gravest character, is
dwarfed by that other objection which springs from
the present toleration of Rebels in the copartnership
of government. Here is a strange oblivion, showing
a strange insensibility.</p>

<p>The Senator from Illinois [Mr. <span class="smcap">Trumbull</span>] argued
that the bill would put the new governments into loyal
hands. Has he read it? My precise objection is, that
it does not put the government into loyal hands. Look
at it carefully, and you will see this staring you in the
face at all points. While requiring suffrage for all,
without distinction of race or color, it leaves the machinery
and motive power in the hands of the existing
governments, which are conducted by Rebels. Therefore,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_291" id="Page_291">[Pg 291]</a></span>
under this bill, Rebels will initiate and conduct
the work of Reconstruction, while loyal citizens stand
aside. The President once said, “For the Rebels back
seats.” This bill says, “For the loyal citizens back
seats.” Nobody is disfranchised. There is no traitor,
red with loyal blood, who may not play his part and
help found the new government. The bill excepts from
voting only “such as <em>may be</em> disfranchised for participation
in the Rebellion.” It does not require that any
body shall be disfranchised, but leaves this whole question
to the existing government, who will, of course,
leave the door wide open.</p>

<p>Looking at this feature, I cannot condemn it too
strongly. It is true that suffrage is at last accorded to
the colored race; but their masters are left in power to
domineer, and even to organize. With experience, craft,
and determined purpose, there is too much reason to
fear that all safeguards will be overthrown, and the
Unionist continue the victim of Rebel power. This
must not be. And you must interfere in advance to
prevent it. You must exercise a just authority in disfranchising
dangerous men. On this point there must
be no uncertainty, no “perhaps.” It is not enough to
say that Rebels <em>may be</em> disfranchised; you must say
<em>must</em>. Without this is surrender.</p>

<p>Such a surrender Congress cannot make. Therefore
do I rejoice with my whole heart that the House of
Representatives has given to the Senate the opportunity
of reconsidering its action and taking the proper steps
for amending the bill. The new governments must
be on a loyal basis. Loyal people must be protected
against Rebels. Here I take my stand. I plead for
those good people, who have suffered as people never<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_292" id="Page_292">[Pg 292]</a></span>
suffered before. I appeal to you as Senators not to
miss this precious opportunity. Take care that the bill
is amended, so that it may be the fountain of peace, and
not the engine of discord and oppression.</p>

<div class="medium">

<p>Mr. Sherman followed in an earnest speech, in the course of which
the following passage occurred.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Sherman.</span> The Senator from Massachusetts now for the first time
in the Senate has stated his opposition to this bill.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Sumner.</span> Allow me to correct the Senator. The Senator was not
here, when, at two o’clock in the morning, I denounced this amendment as
I have, to-day, and much more severely.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Sherman.</span> He now states that the ground of his opposition is, that
the bill does not disfranchise the whole Rebel population of the Southern
States.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Sumner.</span> I beg the Senator’s pardon. I take no such ground.
I say it does not provide proper safeguards against the Rebel population.
I have not opened the question to what extent the disfranchisement
should go.</p>

</div>

<p>The motion of Mr. Sherman was agreed to, and the bill, with the
Senate amendment, was returned to the House, which proceeded
promptly to its consideration. The substitute of the Senate was concurred
in, with a further amendment,&mdash;(1.) excluding from the conventions,
and also from voting, all persons excluded from holding office
under the recent Constitutional Amendment; (2.) declaring civil governments
in the Rebel States provisional only and subject to the
paramount authority of the United States; (3.) conferring the elective
franchise upon all, without distinction of color, in elections under
such provisional governments; and (4.) disqualifying all persons from
office under provisional government who are disqualified by the Constitutional
Amendment. The vote of the House was,&mdash;Yeas 128,
Nays 46.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>February 20th, in the Senate, Mr. Williams moved concurrence
with the House amendments. After brief remarks by Mr. Sherman,
Mr. Sumner said:&mdash;</p>

</div>

<p>I differ from the Senator [Mr. <span class="smcap">Sherman</span>], when he
calls this a small matter. It is a great matter.</p>

<p>I should not say another word but for the singular
speech of the Senator yesterday. He made something<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_293" id="Page_293">[Pg 293]</a></span>
like an assault on me, because I required the
very amendments the House have now made; and yet
he is to support them. I am glad the Senator has
seen light; but he must revise his speech of yesterday.
The Senator shakes his head. What did I ask?
What did I criticize? It was, that the bill failed in
safeguard against Rebels. I did not say how many to
exclude. I only said some must be excluded, more or
less. None were excluded. That brought down the
cataract of speech we all enjoyed, when the Senator
protested with all the ardor of his nature, and invoked
the State of Ohio behind him to oppose the proposition
of the Senator from Massachusetts. And now,
if I understand the Senator from Ohio, he is ready
to place himself side by side with the Senator from
Massachusetts in support of the amendment from the
House embodying this very proposition. I am glad
the Senator is so disposed. I rejoice that he sees light.
To-morrow I hope to welcome the Senator to some other
height.</p>

<div class="medium">

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Cowan</span> [of Pennsylvania]. Excelsior!</p>

</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Sumner.</span> And I hope the word may be applicable
to my friend from Pennsylvania also. [<i>Laughter.</i>]</p>

<p>But there was another remark of the Senator which
struck me with astonishment. He complained that I
demanded these safeguards now, and said that I had
already in the bill all that I had ever demanded before,&mdash;that
universal suffrage, without distinction of
race or color, was secured; and, said he, “the Senator
from Massachusetts has never asked anything but
that.” Now I can well pardon the Senator for ignorance<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_294" id="Page_294">[Pg 294]</a></span>
with regard to what I have said or asked on
former occasions. I cannot expect him to be familiar
with it. And yet, when he openly arraigns me with
the impetuosity of yesterday, I shall be justified in
showing how completely he was mistaken.</p>

<div class="medium">

<p>Here Mr. Sumner referred to his speech before the Massachusetts
Republican State Convention, September 14, 1865, entitled “The
National Security and the National Faith, Guaranties for the National
Freedman and the National Creditor,” and showed how completely
at that time he had anticipated all present demands.<a name="FNanchor_88_88" id="FNanchor_88_88"></a><a href="#Footnote_88_88" class="fnanchor">[88]</a> He
then continued:&mdash;</p>

</div>

<p>And yet, when I simply insisted upon some additional
safeguard against the return of Rebels to power,
the Senator told us that I was asking something new.
Thank God, the other House has supplied the very protection
which I desired; it has laid the foundation of
a true peace. That foundation can be only on a loyal
basis.</p>

<p>Two Presidents&mdash;one always to be named with veneration,
another always most reluctantly&mdash;have united
in this sentiment. Abraham Lincoln insisted that
the new governments should be founded on loyalty;
that, if there were only five thousand loyal persons in
a State, they were entitled to hold the power. His successor
adopted the same principle, when, in different
language, he compendiously said, “For the Rebels back
seats.” What is now required could not be expressed
better. “For the Rebels back seats,” until this great
work of Reconstruction is achieved.</p>

<div class="medium">

<p>Mr. Sherman, and Mr. Stewart, of Nevada, spoke especially in reply
to Mr. Sumner, congratulating him upon his acceptance of the result.
Mr. Sumner followed.</p>

</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_295" id="Page_295">[Pg 295]</a></span></p>

<p>I am sorry to say another word; and yet, if silent,
I might expose myself to misunderstanding. I accept
the amendments from the other House as the best that
can be had now; but I desire it distinctly understood
that I shall not hesitate to insist at all times upon
applying more directly and practically the true principles
of Reconstruction. There is the Louisiana Bill
on our table. The time, I presume, has passed for acting
on it at this session; but in the earliest days of the
next session I shall press that subject as constantly as
I can. I believe you owe it to every one of these
States to supply a government in place of that you
now solemnly declare illegal. In such a government
you will naturally secure a true loyalty, and I wish
to be understood as not in any way circumscribing
myself by the vote of to-day.</p>

<p>It may be that it will be best to require of every
voter the same oath required of all entering Congress,
which we know as the test oath. At least something
more must be done; there must be other safeguards
than those supplied by this very hasty and crude act
of legislation. I accept it as containing much that is
good, some things infinitely good, but as coming short
of what a patriotic Congress ought to supply for the
safety of the Republic.</p>

<p>Let it be understood, then, that I am not compromised
by this bill, or by blandishments of Senators over the
way [Messrs. <span class="smcap">Sherman</span> and <span class="smcap">Stewart</span>]. I listen to them
of course with pleasure, and to all their expressions
of friendship I respond with all my heart. I like much
to go with them; but I value more the safety of my
country. When Senators, even as powerful as the Senator
from Ohio and the Senator from Nevada, take a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_296" id="Page_296">[Pg 296]</a></span>
course which seems to me inconsistent with the national
security, they must not expect me to follow.</p>

<div class="medium">

<p class="dropcap">MR. PRESIDENT,&mdash;I am unwilling that this bill
should be embarrassed by any question of words.
I am for the bill in substance, whatever words may be
employed. Call it a bureau, if you please, or call it
a department; I accept it under either designation.
The Senator from Connecticut [Mr. <span class="smcap">Dixon</span>] has not
too strongly depicted the necessity of the case. We
are to have universal suffrage, a natural consequence
of universal emancipation; but this will be a barren
sceptre in the hands of the people, unless we supply
education also. From the beginning of our troubles, I
have foreseen this question. Through the agency and
under the influence of the National Government education
must be promoted in the Rebel States. To this
end we need some central agency. This, if I understand
it, is supplied by the bill before us.</p>

<p>Call it a bureau or a department; but give us the
bill, and do not endanger it, at this moment, in this
late hour of the session, by unnecessary amendment.
Sir, I would, if I could, give it the highest designation.
If there is any term in our dictionary that would impart
peculiar significance, I should prefer that. Indeed,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_298" id="Page_298">[Pg 298]</a></span>
I should not hesitate, could I have my way, to
place the head of the Department of Education in the
Cabinet of the United States,&mdash;following the practice
of one of the civilized governments of the world. I
refer to France, which for years has had in its Cabinet
a Minister of Education. But no such proposition is
before us. The question is simply on a name; and I
hope we shall not take up time with regard to it.</p>

<div class="medium">

<p>Mr. Poland, of Vermont, introduced a resolution directing the
Sergeant-at-Arms of the Senate to see that monuments were placed
in the Congressional burial-ground, in memory of Senators who had
died at Washington since July 4, 1861. On the question of taking
up this resolution for consideration, Mr. Sumner remarked:&mdash;</p>

</div>

<p class="dropcap">Originally there was a reason for these monuments.
Senators and Representatives dying here
found their last home in the Congressional burial-ground,
and these monuments covered their remains.
At a later day, with increasing facilities of transportation,
the custom of burial here has ceased; but the
monuments, being only cenotaphs, were continued until
1861, when this custom was suspended. Meantime
Death has not been less busy here, and the question
is, whether the former custom shall be revived, and cenotaphs
be placed in an unvisited burial-ground, to mark
the spot where the remains of a Senator might have
been placed, had they not been transported to repose
among his family, kindred, and neighbors.</p>

<p>I cannot but think that the suspension of this custom
of monuments, which occurred at the beginning of the
war, was notice or indication that the occasion for them<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_300" id="Page_300">[Pg 300]</a></span>
had passed; and I doubt sincerely the expediency of
reviving the custom, unless where an associate is actually
buried here. If those dying here, but buried elsewhere,
are to be commemorated by Congress in any
monumental form, it seems to me better that it should
be a simple tablet of stone or brass in the Capitol,
where it would be seen by the visitors thronging here,
and perhaps arrest the attention of their successors in
public duty, teaching how Death enters these Halls.
But why place an unsightly cenotaph in a forlorn
burial-ground,&mdash;I may add, at considerable cost? I
cannot doubt that the time has come for this expense
to cease.</p>

<p>By a joint resolution introduced by Mr. Morgan, of New York, the
President was requested “to cause a gold medal to be struck, with
suitable emblems, devices, and inscription, to be presented to Mr.
Field,” and to “cause a copy of this joint resolution to be engrossed
on parchment, and transmit the same, together with the medal, to
Mr. Field, to be presented to him in the name of the people of the
United States of America.”</p>

<p>March 2d, the joint resolution was considered. After a speech from
Mr. Morgan, Mr. Sumner said:&mdash;</p>

</div>

<p class="dropcap">MR. PRESIDENT,&mdash;I rejoice in every enterprise
by which human industry is quickened and distant
places are brought near together. In ancient days
the builders of roads were treated with godlike honor.
I offer them my homage now. The enterprise which is
to complete the railroad connection between the Pacific
and the Atlantic belongs to this class. But this is not
so peculiar and exceptional as that which has already
connected the two continents by a telegraphic wire. It
is not so historic. It is not itself so great an epoch.</p>

<p>It is not easy to exaggerate the difficulty or the value
of the new achievement.</p>

<p>The enterprise was original in its beginning and in
every stage of its completion. It began by a telegraph<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_302" id="Page_302">[Pg 302]</a></span>
line connecting St. John’s, the most easterly port of
America, with the main continent. This was planned
at the house of Cyrus W. Field, by a few gentlemen,
among whom were Peter Cooper, Moses Taylor, Marshall
O. Roberts, and David Dudley Field. New York
and St. John’s are about twelve hundred miles apart.
When these two points were brought into telegraphic
association, the first link was made in the chain destined
to bind the two continents together. Out of this
American beginning sprang efforts which ended in the
oceanic cable.</p>

<p>In other respects our country led the way. The
first soundings across the Atlantic were by American
officers in American ships. The United States ship
Dolphin first discovered the telegraphic plateau as early
as 1853, and in 1856 the United States ship Arctic
sounded across from Newfoundland to Ireland, a year
before Her Majesty’s ship Cyclops sailed the same
course.</p>

<p>It was not until 1856 that this American enterprise
showed itself in England, where it was carried by Mr.
Field. Through his energies the Atlantic Telegraphic
Company was organized in London, with a board of
directors composed of English bankers and merchants,
among whom was an American citizen, George Peabody.
By conjoint exertions of the two countries the
cable was stretched from continent to continent in
1858. Messages of good-will traversed it. The United
States and England seemed to be near together, while
Queen and President interchanged salutations. Then
suddenly the electric current ceased, and the cable became
a lifeless line. The enterprise itself hardly lived.
But it was again quickened into being, and finally carried<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_303" id="Page_303">[Pg 303]</a></span>
to a successful close. British capital, British skill,
contributed largely, and the society had for its president
an eminent Englishman, the Right Honorable
James Stuart Wortley; but I have always understood
that our countryman was the mainspring. His confidence
never ceased; his energies never flagged. Twelve
years of life and forty voyages across the Atlantic were
woven into this work. He was the Alpha and the
Omega of a triumph which has few parallels in history.</p>

<p>Englishmen who took an active part in this enterprise
have received recognition and honor from the
sovereign. Some have been knighted, others advanced
in service. Meanwhile Cyrus W. Field, who did so
much, has remained unnoticed by our Government.
He has been honored by the popular voice, but it remains
for Congress to embody this voice in a national
testimonial. If it be said that there is no precedent for
such a vote, then do I reply that his case is without
precedent, and we must not hesitate to make a precedent
by this expression of national gratitude. Thanks
are given for victories in war: give them now for a
victory of peace.</p>

<p>“Secondly. Provisional governments must be constituted as temporary
substitutes for the illegal governments, with special authority to superintend
the transition to permanent governments republican in form.</p>

<p>“Thirdly. As loyalty beyond suspicion must be the basis of permanent
governments republican in form, every possible precaution must be
adopted against Rebel agency or influence in the formation of these governments.</p>

<p>“Fourthly. As the education of the people is essential to the national
welfare, and especially to the development of those principles of justice<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_305" id="Page_305">[Pg 305]</a></span>
and morality which constitute the foundation of republican government,
and as, according to the census, an immense proportion of the people in
the Rebel States, without distinction of color, cannot read and write,
therefore public schools must be established for the equal good of all.</p>

<p>“Fifthly. Not less important than education is the homestead, which
must be secured to the freedmen, so that at least every head of a family
may have a piece of land.</p>

<p>“<i>Resolved</i>, That all these requirements are in the nature of guaranties
to be exacted by Congress, without which the United States will not obtain
that security for the future which is essential to a just Reconstruction.”</p>

</div>

<p>March 11th, on motion of Mr. Sumner, the Senate proceeded to consider
the resolutions. Mr. Williams, of Oregon, was not prepared to
vote on these resolutions until they had received the consideration of
some committee, and he moved their reference to the Committee on
the Judiciary.</p>

<p>Mr. Sumner said:&mdash;</p>

</div>

<p class="dropcap">MR. PRESIDENT,&mdash;The Senator from Oregon has
made no criticism on the resolutions, but nevertheless
he objects to proceeding with them now; he
desires reference, he would have the aid of a committee,
before he proceeds with their consideration. If I can
have the attention of the Senator, it seems to me that
this will be as good as a committee. The resolutions
are on the table; they are plain; they are unequivocal;
they are perfectly intelligible; and they make a declaration
of principle and of purpose which at this moment
is of peculiar importance.</p>

<p>Congress has undertaken to provide for the military
government of the Rebel States, and has made certain
requirements with regard to Reconstruction, and there
it stops. It has presented no complete system, and it
has provided no machinery. From this failure our
friends at the South are at this moment in the greatest
anxiety. They are suffering. Former Rebels, or persons
representing the Rebellion, are moving under our<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_306" id="Page_306">[Pg 306]</a></span>
bill to take a leading part. Already the Legislature of
Virginia, packed by Rebels, full of the old Rebel virus,
has undertaken to call a convention under our recent
Act. Let that convention be called, and what is the
condition of those friends to whom you owe protection?
Unless I am misinformed by valued correspondents,
the position of our friends will be very painful.
I have this morning a letter from Mr. Botts,&mdash;I
mention his name because he is well known to all of
us, and I presume he would have no objection to being
quoted on this floor,&mdash;in which he entreats us to provide
some protection for him and other Unionists against
efforts already commenced by Rebels or persons under
Rebel influence.</p>

<p>I am anxious for practical legislation to that end;
but, to pave the way for such legislation, I would have
Congress, at the earliest possible moment, make a declaration
in general terms of its purposes. The Senator
says these resolutions do not propose practical legislation.
I beg the Senator’s pardon: they do not propose
what we call legislation, but they announce to these
Rebel States what we propose to do; they foreshadow
the future; they give notice; they tell the Rebels that
they are not to take part in Reconstruction; and they
tell our friends and the friends of the Union that we
mean to be wakeful with regard to their interests. Such
will be their effect. They are in the nature of a declaration.
At the beginning of the war there was a declaration,
which has been often quoted in both Houses,
with regard to the purposes of the war. Very often
in times past declarations of policy were made in one
House or the other, and sometimes by concurrent resolutions
of the two Chambers. If the occasion requires,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_307" id="Page_307">[Pg 307]</a></span>
the declaration ought to be made. In common times
and under ordinary circumstances there would be no
occasion for such a declaration, but at this moment
there seems peculiar occasion; you must give notice;
and the failure of our bill to meet the present exigency
throws this responsibility upon us.</p>

<p>The next question is as to the character of the notice.
It begins in its title by declaring that certain further
guaranties are required in the Reconstruction of the
Rebel States. Can any Senator doubt that such guaranties
are required? I submit that on that head there
can be no question. I am persuaded that my excellent
friend from Oregon will not question that general statement.</p>

<div class="medium">

<p>Mr. Sumner then took up the several points of the resolutions in
order and explained them. Coming to that declaring the necessity of
a homestead for the freedman, he proceeded:&mdash;</p>

</div>

<p>I believe that all familiar with the processes of Reconstruction
have felt that our work would be incomplete,
unless in some way we secured to the freedman
a piece of land. Only within a few days, gentlemen
fresh from travel through these States have assured me,
that, as they saw the condition of things there, nothing
pressed upon their minds more than the necessity of
such a provision. The more you reflect upon it, and
the more you listen to evidence, the stronger will be
your conclusion as to this necessity.</p>

<p>Do you ask as to the power of Congress? Again I
say, you find it precisely where you found the power
to confer universal suffrage. To give a homestead will
be no more than to give a vote. You have done the
one, and now you must do the other. We are told
that to him that hath shall be given; and as you have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_308" id="Page_308">[Pg 308]</a></span>
already given the ballot, you must go further, and give
not only education, but the homestead. Nor can you
hesitate for want of power. The time for hesitation
has passed.</p>

<div class="medium">

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Fessenden</span> [of Maine]. I should like to ask my
friend a question, with his permission.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Sumner.</span> Certainly.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Fessenden.</span> The Senator put the granting of the
ballot on the ground that without it the Government would
not be republican in form, as I understood his argument.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Sumner.</span> Yes.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Fessenden.</span> Now I should like to know if he puts
the possession by every man of a piece of land on the same
ground.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Sumner.</span> I do not.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Fessenden.</span> The Senator assimilated the two, and
said, that, having done the one, we must do the other. I
supposed, perhaps, the same process of reasoning applied to
both.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Sumner.</span> No; the homestead stands on the necessity
of the case, to complete the work of the ballot.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Grimes</span> [of Iowa]. Have we not done that under
the Homestead Law?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Sumner.</span> The freedmen are not excluded from the
Homestead Law; but I would provide them with a piece
of land where they are.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Fessenden.</span> That is more than we do for white men.</p>

</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Sumner.</span> White men have never been in slavery;
there is no emancipation and no enfranchisement
of white men to be consummated. I put it to my friend,
I ask his best judgment, can he see a way to complete
and crown this great and glorious work without securing
land? My friend before me [Mr. <span class="smcap">Grimes</span>] asks,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_309" id="Page_309">[Pg 309]</a></span>
“How are we to get the land?” There are several
ways. By a process of confiscation we should have had
enough; and I have no doubt that the country would
have been better, had the great landed estates of the
South been divided and subdivided among the loyal
colored population. That is the judgment of many
Unionists at the South. I say nothing on that point;
but clearly there are lands through the South belonging
to the United States, or that have fallen to the United
States through the failure to pay taxes. It has always
seemed to me that in the exercise of the pardoning
power it would have been easy for the President to
require that the person who was to receive a pardon
should allot a certain portion of his lands to his freedmen.
That might have been annexed as a condition.
A President properly inspired, and disposed to organize
a true Reconstruction, could not have hesitated in such
a requirement. That would have been a very simple
process. I am aware that Congress cannot affect the
pardoning power; but still I doubt not there is something
that can be done by Congress. Where Congress
has done so much, I am unwilling to believe it cannot
do all that the emergency requires. Let us not
shrink from the difficulties. With regard to the homestead
there may be difficulties, but not on that account
should we hesitate. We must assure peace and security
to these people, and, to that end, consider candidly,
gently, carefully, the proper requirements, and then fearlessly
provide for them.</p>

<p>There is still another, which I have not named in
these resolutions, though I have employed it in the careful
and somewhat extended Reconstruction Bill which
I have laid on the table of the Senate, and which some<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_310" id="Page_310">[Pg 310]</a></span>
time I may try to call up for discussion,&mdash;and that is,
the substitution of the vote by ballot for the vote <i>viva
voce</i>. Letters from Virginia, and also from other parts
of the South, all plead for this change. They say, that,
so long as the vote <i>viva voce</i> continues, it will be difficult
for the true Union men to organize; they will
be under check and control from the Rebels. I have a
letter, received only this morning, from a Unionist, from
which I will read a brief passage.</p>

<p class="center">…</p>

<p>Now does my excellent friend from Oregon, who
wishes to bury this effort in a committee, doubt the
concluding resolution? Can he hesitate to say that
every one of these requirements is in the nature of a
guaranty, without which we shall not obtain that complete
security for the future which our country has a
right to expect? There they are. That the illegal governments
must be vacated. Who can doubt that?
That provisional governments must be constituted as
temporary substitutes for the illegal governments. Who
can doubt that? That the new governments must be
founded on an unalterable basis of loyalty, and to that
end no Rebels must be allowed to exert influence or
agency in the formation of the new governments. Who
can doubt that? Then, again, education: who can doubt?
Certainly not my friend from Oregon: he will not doubt
the importance of education as a corner-stone of Reconstruction.
It is a golden moment. We have the power.
Let us not fail to exercise it. Exercising it now, we
can shape the destinies of that people for the future.
There remains the homestead. I see the practical difficulties;
but I do not despair. Let us apply ourselves
to them, and I do not doubt that we can secure substantially<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_311" id="Page_311">[Pg 311]</a></span>
to every head of a family among the freedmen
a piece of land, and we may then go further, and,
in the way of machinery, provide a vote by ballot instead
of a vote <i>viva voce</i>.</p>

<p>Now I insist that all these are in the nature of guaranties
of future peace, and we should not hesitate in
doing all within our power to secure them. I hope,
therefore, that Senators will act on these resolutions
without reference to a committee. I see no occasion
for a reference. There is one objection, at least, on
the face: it will cause delay. Let these resolutions be
adopted and go to the country, and you will find that
the gratitude of the American people, and of all Union
men at the South, will come up to Congress for your
act.</p>

<div class="medium">

<p>Mr. Dixon, of Connecticut, deprecated the adoption of the resolutions.
The bill recently passed “purported to be final.… It provided
certain terms, harsh and severe in the extreme, upon which
the States formerly in rebellion should be restored to the Union.”
He then remarked: “These resolutions come from the right quarter.
Whatever may be my opinion of his [Mr. <span class="smcap">Sumner’s</span>] political views,
I will say for that Senator, that for the last two years he has been
prophetic; what he has announced, what he has declared, what he
has said must be law, has become law upon many subjects.… Let
us know what is coming; let us see the worst.… While I was
very glad to find&mdash;if I understood them correctly&mdash;that the Senator
from Maine [Mr. <span class="smcap">Fessenden</span>] and some other Senators about me did
not coincide with the views of the Senator from Massachusetts, I could
not forget that two years ago I heard a Senator on this floor say that
upon another subject there was not a single Senator here who agreed
with the Senator from Massachusetts; and yet upon that very subject
I believe every Senator on the majority side of the Senate now, if not
at heart concurring with him, acts and votes with him.”</p>

<p>Mr. Sherman, of Ohio, opposed the resolutions. It seemed to him
“not exactly fair or just or ingenuous to the Southern people to add
new terms, or require of them additional guaranties, as conditions to
the admission of representation.”</p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_312" id="Page_312">[Pg 312]</a></span>
<p>Mr. Reverdy Johnson, of Maryland, voted for the recent bill because
he thought he saw in opinions of Mr. Sumner, “and a few others who
concur with him, that, if the measure then before the Senate was not
adopted, harsher, much harsher, measures would in the end be exacted
of the South.”</p>

<p>Mr. Frelinghuysen, of New Jersey, thought the resolutions “unfair
to Congress and unfair to the country.”</p>

<p>Mr. Sumner said in reply:&mdash;</p>

</div>

<p>The objects which I seek in Reconstruction are regarded
in very different lights by myself and by Senators
who have spoken. The Senator from New Jersey,
the Senator from Maryland, and the Senator from Ohio
all regard these requirements as in the nature of burdens
or penalties. Education is a burden or penalty;
a homestead is a burden or penalty. It is a new burden
or penalty which I am seeking&mdash;so these distinguished
Senators argue&mdash;to impose upon the South.
Are they right, or am I right? Education can never
be burden or penalty. Justice in the way of a homestead
can never be burden or penalty. Each is a sacred
duty which the nation owes to those who rightfully
look to us for protection.</p>

<p>Now, at this moment, in the development of events,
the people at the South rightfully look to us for protection.
They rightfully look to us, that, in laying the
foundation-stone of future security, we shall see that
those things are done which will make the security
real, and not merely nominal. And yet, when I ask
that the security shall be real, and not merely nominal,
I am encountered by the objection that I seek to
impose new burdens,&mdash;that I am harsh. Sir, if I know
my own heart, I would not impose a burden upon any
human being. I would not impose a burden even upon
those who have trespassed so much against the Republic.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_313" id="Page_313">[Pg 313]</a></span>
I do not seek their punishment. Never has one
word fallen from my lips asking for their punishment,
for any punishment of the South. All that I ask is the
establishment of human rights on a permanent foundation.
Is there any Senator who differs from me? I
am sure that my friend from Ohio seeks the establishment
of future security; but he will allow me to say,
that to my mind he abandons it at the beginning,&mdash;he
fails at the proper moment to require guaranties without
which future security will be vain.</p>

<p>This is not the first time that the Senator from Ohio
has set himself against fundamental propositions of Reconstruction.
When, now more than four years ago, I
had the honor of introducing into this Chamber a proposition
declaring the jurisdiction of Congress over this
whole question, and over the whole Rebel region, I was
met by the Senator, who reminded me that I was alone,
and did not hesitate to say that my position was not
unlike that of Jefferson Davis.</p>

<div class="medium">

<p>Here Mr. Sumner sent to the desk the speech of Mr. Sherman,
April 2, 1862, and the Secretary read what he said of Mr. Sumner’s
position.</p>

</div>

<p>I have not called attention to these remarks in any
unkind spirit, for I have none for the Senator; I have
no feeling but kindness and respect for him; but as
I listened to him a few minutes ago, remonstrating
against the position I now occupy, I was carried back
to that early day when he remonstrated, if possible,
more strenuously against the position I then occupied.
I had the audacity then to assert the paramount power
of Congress over the whole Rebel region. That was
the sum and substance of my argument; and you have
heard the answer of the Senator. And now, in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_314" id="Page_314">[Pg 314]</a></span>
lapse of time, the Senator has ranged himself by my
side, voting for that measure of Reconstruction which
is founded on the jurisdiction of Congress over the
whole Rebel region.</p>

<p>As time passed, the subject assumed another character.
It was with regard to the suffrage. A year ago
I asserted on this floor that we must give the suffrage
to all colored persons by Act of Congress and without
Constitutional Amendment, founding myself on two
grounds. One was the solemn guaranty in the Constitution
of a republican form of government; and I
undertook to show that any denial of rights on account
of color was unrepublican to such extent that the government
sanctioning it could not be considered in any
just sense republican. I then went further, and insisted,
that, from the necessity of the case, at the present
moment, Congress must accord the suffrage to all
persons at the South, without distinction of color. I
argued that the suffrage of colored citizens was needed
to counterbalance the suffrage of the Rebels.<a name="FNanchor_92_92" id="FNanchor_92_92"></a><a href="#Footnote_92_92" class="fnanchor">[92]</a> One year
has passed, and now, by Act of Congress, you have
asserted the very power which the Senator from Ohio,
and other distinguished Senators associated with him,
most strenuously denied. That Senator and other Senators
insisted that it could be only by Constitutional
Amendment. I insisted that it could be under the existing
text of the Constitution; nay, more, that from
the necessity of the case it must be in this way. And
in this way it has been done.</p>

<p>But, in doing it, you have unhappily failed to make
proper provision for enforcing this essential security.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_315" id="Page_315">[Pg 315]</a></span>
You have provided no machinery, and you have left
other things undone which ought to be done. And
now, urging that these things should be done, I am
encountered again by my friend from Ohio, whom I
had encountered before on these other cardinal propositions;
and he now, just as strenuously as before, insists
that it is not within our power or province at this
moment to make any additional requirements of the
Rebel States. He is willing that the bill in certain
particulars shall be amended. I do not know precisely
to what extent he would go; but he will make no additional
requirements, as he expresses it, in the nature
of burdens. Sir, I make no additional requirements in
the nature of burdens. I have already said, I impose
no burdens upon any man; but I insist upon the protection
of rights. And now, at this moment, as we are
engaged in this great work of Reconstruction, I insist
that the work shall be completely done. It will not
be completely done, if you fail to supply any safeguards
or precautions that can possibly be adopted.</p>

<p>A great orator has told us that he had but one lamp
by which his feet were guided, and that was the lamp of
experience.<a name="FNanchor_93_93" id="FNanchor_93_93"></a><a href="#Footnote_93_93" class="fnanchor">[93]</a> There is one transcendent experience, commanding,
historic, which illumines this age. It is more
than a lamp; it is sunshine. I mean the example afforded
by the Emperor of Russia, when he set free twenty
million serfs. Did he stop with their freedom? He
went further, and provided for their education, and also
that each should have a piece of land. And now, when
I ask that my country, a republic, heir of all the ages,
foremost in the tide of time, should do on this question<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_316" id="Page_316">[Pg 316]</a></span>
only what the Emperor of Russia has done, I am
met by grave Senators with the reproach that I am
imposing new burdens. It is no such thing. I am
only asking new advantages for all in that distracted
region, with new securities for my country, to the end
that it may be safe, great, and glorious.</p>

<div class="medium">

<p>March 5th, Mr. Sumner asked, and by unanimous consent obtained,
leave to bring in the following joint resolution, which was
read twice and ordered to be printed.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p class="center">“<span class="smcap">Joint Resolution</span> presenting the thanks of Congress to George Peabody.</p>

<p>“<i>Resolved by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United
States of America in Congress assembled</i>, That the thanks of Congress
be, and they hereby are, presented to George Peabody, of Massachusetts,
for his great and peculiar beneficence in giving a large sum of money,
amounting to two million dollars, for the promotion of education in the
more destitute portions of the Southern and Southwestern States, the benefits
of which, according to his direction, are to be distributed among the
entire population, without any distinction, except what may be found in
needs or opportunities of usefulness.</p>

<p>“<span class="smcap">Sec. 2.</span> <i>And be it further enacted</i>, That it shall be the duty of the
President to cause a gold medal to be struck, with suitable devices and
inscriptions, which, together with a copy of this resolution, shall be presented
to Mr. Peabody in the name of the people of the United States.”</p>

</div>

<p>March 8th, on motion of Mr. Sumner, the joint resolution was taken
up for consideration, when the latter said:&mdash;</p>

</div>

<p class="dropcap">MR. PRESIDENT,&mdash;I hope sincerely that there
can be no question on this resolution. It expresses
the thanks of Congress for an act great in itself,
and also great as an example.</p>

<p>I recall no instance in history where a private person
during life has bestowed so large a sum in charity.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_318" id="Page_318">[Pg 318]</a></span>
Few after death have done so much. The bequest of
Smithson, which Congress accepted with honor, and
made the foundation of the institution bearing his
name and receiving our annual care, was much less
than the donation of Mr. Peabody for purposes of education
in the South and Southwestern States, to be distributed
among the whole population, without any distinction
other than needs or opportunities of usefulness
to them.</p>

<p>I hail this benefaction as of especial value now:
first, as a contribution to education, which is a sacred
cause never to be forgotten in a republic; secondly,
as a charity to a distressed part of our country which
needs the help of education; and, thirdly, as an endowment
for the equal benefit of all, without distinction of
caste. As it is much in itself, so I cannot but think
it will be most fruitful as an example. Individuals
and communities will be moved to do more in the same
direction, and impartial education may be added to recent
triumphs.</p>

<p>I am not led to consider the difference between the
widow’s mite and the rich man’s endowment, except
to remark, that, when a charity is so large as to become
historic, it is necessarily taken out of the category of
common life. Standing apart by itself, it challenges
attention and fills the mind, receiving homage and gratitude.
Such, I am sure, has been the prevailing sentiment
of our country toward Mr. Peabody. In voting
this resolution, Congress will only give expression to
the popular voice.</p>

<p>I should be sorry to have it understood that the
thanks of Congress can be won only in war. Peace
also has victories deserving honor. A public benefactor<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_319" id="Page_319">[Pg 319]</a></span>
is a conqueror in the perpetual conflict with evil.
He, too, meets the enemy face to face. Let him also
have the reward of victory.</p>

<p>Already in England our benefactor has signalized
himself by a generous endowment of the poor. The
sum he gave was large, but not so large as he has
given for education in our country. The sentiments of
the British people found expression through the Queen,
who honored him with a valuable present, her own
portrait, and an autograph letter declaring her grateful
sense of his beneficence. Kindred sentiments may
justly find expression through Congress, which is empowered
to write the autograph of the American people.</p>

<p>If it be said that such a vote is without precedent, I
reply that this is a mistake. You voted thanks to Mr.
Vanderbilt for the present of a steamer, and to Mr.
Field for generous enterprise in establishing the telegraphic
cable between the two continents. But even if
there were no precedent, then, do I say, make a precedent.
Your vote will be less unprecedented than his
generosity.</p>

<p>At this moment, when we are engaged in the work
of Reconstruction, this endowment for education in the
Southern and Southwestern States is most timely. Education
is the foundation-stone of that Republican Government
we seek to establish. On this account, also, I
would honor the benefactor.</p>

<p>I have not asked a reference to a committee, because
it seemed that the resolution was of such a character
that the Senate would be glad to act upon it directly.
The thanks we offer will be of more value, if promptly
offered.</p>

<small>THE BALLOT AND PUBLIC SCHOOLS OPEN TO ALL.</small></h2>

<p class="plabeln"><span class="smcap">Speeches in the Senate, on the Supplementary Reconstruction
Bill, March 15 and 16, 1867.</span></p>

<div class="figcenter">

</div>

<div class="medium">

<p>To counteract the malign influence of President Johnson, and to
protect the public interest jeopardized by his conduct, Congress provided
for a session to commence March 4, 1867, immediately after the
expiration of its predecessor. The new Congress was signalized by a
second Reconstruction Bill, “supplementary to an Act to provide for
the more efficient government of the Rebel States,” passed March 2,
1867, which was promptly introduced into the House of Representatives
and passed.</p>

<p>As early as March 13th, the House bill was reported to the Senate
from the Judiciary Committee, with a substitute, and for several days
thereafter it was considered. Among the various amendments moved
was one by Mr. Drake, of Missouri, providing that the registered electors
should declare, by their votes of “Convention” or “No Convention,”
whether a convention to frame a constitution should be held,
which was rejected,&mdash;Yeas 17, Nays 27.</p>

<p>March 15th, Mr. Fessenden, of Maine, moved an amendment, that
the commanding general should furnish a copy of the registration to
the Provisional Government of the State; and whenever thereafter
the Provisional Government should by legal enactment provide that
a convention should be called, the commanding general should then
direct an election of delegates. In the debate on this proposition,
Mr. Sumner said:&mdash;</p>

</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_322" id="Page_322">[Pg 322]</a></span></p>

<p class="dropcap">MR. PRESIDENT,&mdash;In voting on the proposition
of the Senator from Maine, I ask myself one
question: How would the Union men of the South
vote, if they had the privilege? They are unrepresented.
We here ought to be the representatives of
the unrepresented. How, then, would the Union men
of the South vote on the proposition of the Senator?
I cannot doubt, that, with one voice, they would vote
No. They would not trust their fortunes in any way
to the existing governments of the Rebel States. Those
governments have been set up in spite of the Union
men, and during their short-lived existence they have
trampled upon Union men and upon their rights. That
region might be described as bleeding at every pore,
and much through the action of the existing governments,
owing their origin to the President. So long
as they continue, their influence must be pernicious.
I hear, then, the voice of every Union man from every
one of the Rebel States coming up to this Chamber
and entreating us to refuse all trust, all power, to these
Legislatures. I listen to their voice, and shall vote accordingly.</p>

<p>But I feel, nevertheless, that something ought to be
done in the direction of the proposition of the Senator
from Maine. I listened to his remarks, and in their
spirit I entirely concur; but it seems to me that his
argument carried us naturally to the proposition of the
Senator from Missouri. To my mind, that proposition
is founded in good sense, in prudence, in a just economy
of political forces. It begins at the right end. It begins
with the people. The Senator proposes that the
new governments, when constituted, shall stand on that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_323" id="Page_323">[Pg 323]</a></span>
broad base. The proposition of the Committee stands
the pyramid on its apex. I am therefore for the proposition
of the Senator from Missouri, and I hope that
at the proper time he will renew it, and give us another
opportunity of recording our votes in its favor.</p>

<div class="medium">

<p>The amendment of Mr. Fessenden was rejected,&mdash;Yeas 14, Nays 33.</p>

<p>March 16th, Mr. Sumner moved to insert “all” before “electors,”
and to substitute “registered” for “qualified,” so as to read, “ratified
by a majority of the votes of all the electors registered as herein
specified.” After debate, the amendment was rejected,&mdash;Yeas 19,
Nays 25.</p>

<p>Mr. Drake subsequently renewed his rejected amendment, with a
modification that the result should be determined by a majority of those
voting, and it was adopted. Mr. Conkling, of New York, moved to
reconsider the last vote, so as to provide that the result should be
determined by a majority of all the votes registered, instead of a
majority of all the votes given. On this motion, Mr. Sumner remarked:&mdash;</p>

</div>

<p>I said nothing, when the question was up before;
but I cannot allow the vote to be taken now without
expressing in one word the ground on which I shall
place my vote.</p>

<p>We have just come out from the fires of a terrible
Rebellion, and our special purpose now is to set up
safeguards against the recurrence of any such calamity,
and also for the establishment of peace and tranquillity
throughout that whole region. There is no Senator
within the sound of my voice who is not anxious
to see that great end accomplished. How shall it be
done? By founding government on a majority or on
a minority? If these were common times, then I should
listen to the argument of the Senator from Missouri
[Mr. <span class="smcap">Drake</span>], and also of the Senator from Indiana [Mr.
<span class="smcap">Morton</span>], to the effect that the government might be
founded on a majority of those who actually vote, although<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_324" id="Page_324">[Pg 324]</a></span>
really a minority of the population; but at this
moment, when we are seeking to recover ourselves from
the Rebellion, and to guard against it in future, I cannot
expose the country to any such hazard. I would
take the precaution to found government solidly, firmly,
on a majority,&mdash;not merely a majority of those who
vote, but a majority of all registered voters. Then will
the government be rooted and anchored in principle,
so that it cannot be brushed aside. How was it when
the Rebellion began? Everything was by minorities.
A minority in every State carried it into rebellion.
I would have the new government planted firmly on a
majority, so that it can never again be disturbed. I can
see no real certainty of security for the future without
this safeguard.</p>

<div class="medium">

<p>The motion to reconsider prevailed,&mdash;Yeas 21, Nays 18; but the
amendment of Mr. Conkling was rejected,&mdash;Yeas 17, Nays 22,&mdash;when
Mr. Drake’s amendment was again adopted. Then, on motion
of Mr. Edmunds, of Vermont, it was provided “that such convention
shall not be held, unless a majority of all such registered voters shall
have voted on the question of holding such convention,”&mdash;Yeas 21,
Nays 18.</p>

<p>Mr. Drake then moved to require in the new constitutions, “that,
at all elections by the people for State, county, or municipal officers,
the electors shall vote by ballot,” and this was adopted,&mdash;Yeas 22,
Nays 19. Mr. Trumbull, of Illinois, at once moved to reconsider the
last vote, and was sustained by Mr. Williams, of Oregon, Mr. Stewart,
of Nevada, and Mr. Morton, of Indiana. Mr. Sumner sustained the
amendment.</p>

</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. President</span>,&mdash;The argument of the Senator from
Oregon proceeds on the idea that this is a small question.
He belittles it, and then puts it aside. He treats
it as of form only, and then scorns it. Sir, it may be
a question of form, but it is a form vital to the substance,
vital to that very suffrage which the Senator<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_325" id="Page_325">[Pg 325]</a></span>
undertakes to vindicate. Does the Senator know that
at this moment the special question which tries British
reformers is the ballot? To that our heroic friend,
John Bright, has dedicated his life. He seeks to give
the people of England vote by ballot. He constantly
looks to our country for the authority of a great example.
And now the Senator is willing to overturn that
example. I will not, by my vote, consent to any such
thing. I would reinforce the liberal cause, not only in
my own country, but everywhere throughout the world;
and that cause, I assure you, is staked in part on this
very question.</p>

<p>No, Sir,&mdash;it is not a small question. It cannot be
treated as trivial. It is a great question. Call it, if
you please, a question of form; but it is so closely associated
with substance that it becomes substance. I
hope the Senate will not recede from the generous and
patriotic vote it has already given. I trust it will stand
firm. Ask any student of republican institutions what
is one of their admitted triumphs, and he will name the
vote by ballot. There can be no doubt about it. Do
not dishonor the ballot, but see that it is required in
the constitutions of these Rebel States. The Senator
from Oregon raises no question of power. Congress has
the power. That is enough. You must exercise it.</p>

<div class="medium">

<p>Mr. Drake then modified his amendment, so that, instead of “all
elections by the people for State, county, or municipal officers,” it
should read, “all elections by the people,” and it was rejected,&mdash;Yeas
17, Nays 22. Mr. Sumner then remarked:&mdash;</p>

</div>

<p>The Senate has been occupied for two days in the
discussion of questions, many merely of form. I propose
now to call attention to one of substance, with
which, as I submit, the best interests of the Rebel<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_326" id="Page_326">[Pg 326]</a></span>
States and of the Republic at large are connected. I
send to the Chair an amendment, to come in at the
end of section four.</p>

<div class="medium">

<p>The Secretary read the proposed amendment, as follows:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“<i>Provided</i>, That the constitution shall require the Legislature to establish
and sustain a system of public schools open to all, without distinction
of race or color.”</p>

</div>

<p>Mr. Sumner proceeded to say:&mdash;</p>

</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. President</span>,&mdash;I shall vote for this bill,&mdash;not
because it is what I desire, but because it is all that
Congress is disposed to enact at the present time. I
do not like to play the part of Cassandra,&mdash;but I cannot
forbear declaring my conviction that we shall regret
hereafter that we have not done more. I am
against procrastination. But I am also against precipitation.
I am willing to make haste; but, following
the ancient injunction, I would make haste slowly:
in other words, I would make haste so that our work
may be well done and the Republic shall not suffer.
Especially would I guard carefully all those who justly
look to us for protection, and I would see that the new
governments are founded in correct principles. You
have the power. Do not forget that duties are in proportion
to powers.</p>

<p>I speak frankly. Let me, then, confess my regret
that Congress chooses to employ the military power
for purposes of Reconstruction. The army is for protection.
This is its true function. When it undertakes
to govern or to institute government, it does what
belongs to the civil power. Clearly it is according to
the genius of republican institutions that the military
should be subordinate to the civil. <i>Cedant arma togæ</i><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_327" id="Page_327">[Pg 327]</a></span>
is an approved maxim, not to be disregarded with impunity.
Even now, a fresh debate in the British Parliament
testifies to this principle. Only a fortnight ago,
the Royal Duke of Cambridge, cousin to the Queen,
and commander of the forces, used these words:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“The practice of calling out troops to quell civil disturbances
is exceedingly objectionable; <em>but it must not be forgotten
that the initiative in such cases is always taken by the
civil authorities themselves</em>.”<a name="FNanchor_95_95" id="FNanchor_95_95"></a><a href="#Footnote_95_95" class="fnanchor">[95]</a></p>

</div>

<p>This declaration, though confined to a particular case,
embodies an important rule of conduct, which to my
mind is of special application now.</p>

<p>By the system you have adopted, the civil is subordinate
to the military, and the civilian yields to the
soldier. You accord to the army an “initiative” which
I would assure to the civil power. I regret this. I
am unwilling that Reconstruction should have a military
“initiative.” I would not see new States born of
the bayonet. Leaving to the army its proper duties
of protection, I would intrust Reconstruction to provisional
governments, civil in character and organized by
Congress. You have already pronounced the existing
governments illegal. Logically you should proceed to
supply their places by other governments, while the
military is in the nature of police, until permanent governments
are organized, republican in form and loyal
in character. During this transition period, permanent
governments might be matured on safe foundations and
the people educated to a better order of things. As
the twig is bent the tree inclines: you may now bend
the twig. These States are like a potter’s vessel: you
may mould them to be vessels of honor or of dishonor.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_328" id="Page_328">[Pg 328]</a></span></p>

<p>From the beginning I have maintained these principles.
Again and again I have expressed them in the
Senate and elsewhere. At the last session I insisted
upon the Louisiana Bill in preference to the Military
Bill. In the earliest moments of the present session I
introduced a bill of my own, prepared with the best care
I could bestow, in which was embodied what seemed
to me a proper and practical system of Reconstruction,
with provisional governments to superintend the work
and pave the way for permanent governments. This
measure, which I now hold in my hand, is entitled
“A Bill to guaranty a republican form of government
in Virginia, North Carolina, South Carolina, Georgia,
Florida, Alabama, Mississippi, Louisiana, Arkansas, and
Texas, and to provide for the restoration of these States
to practical relations with the Union.” Its character is
seen in its title. It is not a military bill, or a bill to
authorize Reconstruction by military power; but it is
a bill essentially civil from beginning to end.</p>

<p>The principles on which this bill proceeds appear in
its preamble, which, with the permission of the Senate,
I will read.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“Whereas in the years 1860 and 1861 the inhabitants of
Virginia, North Carolina, South Carolina, Georgia, Florida,
Alabama, Mississippi, Louisiana, Arkansas, and Texas changed
their respective constitutions so as to make them repugnant
to the Constitution of the United States;</p>

<p>“And whereas the inhabitants of these States made war
upon the United States, and after many battles finally surrendered,
under the rules and usages of war;</p>

<p>“And whereas the inhabitants of these States, at the time
of their surrender, were without legal State governments, and,
as a rebel population, were without authority to form legal<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_329" id="Page_329">[Pg 329]</a></span>
State governments, or to exercise any other political functions
belonging to loyal citizens, and they must so continue
until relieved of such disabilities by the law-making power
of the United States;</p>

<p>“And whereas it belongs to Congress, in the discharge of
its duties under the Constitution, to secure to each of these
States a republican form of government, and to provide for
the restoration of each to practical relations with the Union;</p>

<p>“And whereas, until these things are done, it is important
that provisional governments should be established in these
States, with legal power to protect good citizens in the enjoyment
of their rights, and to watch over the formation of State
governments, so that the same shall be truly loyal and republican:
Therefore”&mdash;&mdash;</p>

</div>

<p>With this preamble, exhibiting precisely the necessity
and reasons of Reconstruction, the bill begins by
declaring that the provisional governments shall convene
on the fourth Monday after its passage, and shall
continue until superseded by permanent governments,
created by the people of these States respectively, and
recognized by Congress as loyal and republican. It
then establishes an executive power in each State,
vested in a governor appointed by the President by
and with the advice and consent of the Senate, and
not to be removed except by such advice and consent.
The legislative power is vested in the governor and in
thirteen citizens, called a legislative council, appointed
by and with the advice and consent of the Senate, and
not to be removed except by such advice and consent.
All these, being officers of the United States, must take
the test oath prescribed already by Act of Congress;
and the bill adds a further oath to maintain a republican
form of government, as follows:&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_330" id="Page_330">[Pg 330]</a></span></p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“I do hereby swear (or affirm) that I will at all times use
my best endeavors to maintain a republican form of government
in the State of which I am an inhabitant and in the
Union of the United States; that I will recognize the indissoluble
unity of the Republic, and will discountenance and
resist any endeavor to break away or secede from the Union;
that I will give my influence and vote to strengthen and sustain
the National credit; that I will discountenance and resist
every attempt, directly or indirectly, to repudiate or postpone,
in any part or in any way, the debt which was contracted
by the United States in subduing the late Rebellion,
or the obligations assumed to the Union soldiers; that I will
discountenance and resist every attempt to induce the United
States or any State to assume or pay any debt or obligation
incurred in aid of rebellion against the United States, or any
claim for the loss or emancipation of any slave; that I will
discountenance and resist all laws making any distinction of
race or color; that I will give my support to education and
the diffusion of knowledge by public schools open to all; and
that in all ways I will strive to maintain a State government
completely loyal to the Union, where all men shall enjoy
equal protection and equal rights.”</p>

</div>

<p>I know well the whole history of oaths, and how
often they are the occasion of perjury by the wholesale.
But I cannot resist the conclusion that at this
moment, when we are taking securities for the future,
we ought to seize the opportunity of impressing upon
the people fundamental principles on which alone our
Government can stand. You may exclude Rebels; but
their children, who are not excluded, have inherited the
Rebel spirit. The schools and colleges of the South
have been nurseries of Rebellion. I would exact from
all seeking the public service, or even the elective franchise,
a pledge to support a republican government;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_331" id="Page_331">[Pg 331]</a></span>
and to make this pledge perfectly clear, so that all may
understand its extent, I would enumerate the points
which are essential. If a citizen cannot give this pledge,
he ought to have no part in Reconstruction. He must
stand aside.</p>

<p>From this requirement the bill proceeds to enumerate
certain classes excluded from office and also from
the elective franchise. This is less stringent than what
is known as the Louisiana Bill. It does not exclude
citizens who have not held office, unless where they
have left their homes within the jurisdiction of the
United States and passed within the Rebel lines to
give aid and comfort to the Rebellion,&mdash;or where they
have voluntarily contributed to any loan or securities
for the benefit of any of the Rebel States or the central
government thereof,&mdash;or where, as authors, publishers,
editors, or as speakers or preachers, they have
encouraged the secession of any State or the waging
of war against the United States.</p>

<p>The bill then provides for executive and judicial
officers, and for their salaries, under the provisional
government; also for grand and petit juries; also for
a militia. But all officers, jurors, and militiamen must
take the oath that they are not in the excluded classes,
and also the oath to support a republican form of government.</p>

<p>The bill then annuls existing legislatures; also the
acts of conventions which framed ordinances of secession,
and the acts of legislatures since, subject to certain
conditions; and it provides that the judgments
and decrees of court, which have not been voluntarily
executed, and which have been rendered subsequently
to the date of the ordinance of secession, shall be subject<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_332" id="Page_332">[Pg 332]</a></span>
to appeal to the highest court in the State, organized
after its restoration to the Union. Safeguards like these
seem essential to the protection of the citizen.</p>

<p>The bill does what it can for education by requiring&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“That it shall be the duty of the governor and legislative
council in each of these States to establish public schools,
which shall be open to all, without distinction of race or
color, to the end, that, where suffrage is universal, education
may be universal also, and the new governments find support
in the intelligence of the people.”</p>

</div>

<p>Such are the provisional governments.</p>

<p>The bill then provides for permanent governments
republican and truly loyal. For this purpose the governor
must make a registration of male citizens twenty-one
years of age, of whatever color, race, or former condition,
and, on the completion of this register, invite
all to take the oath that they are not in the excluded
classes, and also the oath to maintain a republican form
of government; and if a majority of the persons duly
registered shall take these oaths, then he is to order an
election for members of a convention to frame a State
constitution. Nobody can vote or sit as a member of
the convention except those who have taken the two
oaths; but no person can be disqualified on account of
race or color. All qualified as voters are eligible as
members of the convention.</p>

<p>The constitution must contain in substance certain
fundamental conditions, never to be changed without
consent of Congress:&mdash;</p>

<p>First, That the Union is perpetual;</p>

<p>Secondly, That Slavery is abolished;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_333" id="Page_333">[Pg 333]</a></span></p>

<p>Thirdly, That there shall be no denial of the elective
franchise, or of any other right, on account of race or
color, but all persons shall be equal before the law;</p>

<p>Fourthly, That the National debt, including pensions
and bounties to Union soldiers, shall never be repudiated
or postponed;</p>

<p>Fifthly, That the Rebel debt, whether contracted by
a Rebel State or by the central government, shall never
be recognized or paid; nor shall any claim for the loss
or emancipation of any slave, or any pension or bounty
for service in the Rebellion, be recognized or paid;</p>

<p>Sixthly, That public schools shall be established, open
to all without distinction of race or color;</p>

<p>Seventhly, That all persons excluded from office under
this Act shall be excluded by the constitution, until
relieved from disability by Act of Congress.</p>

<p>The constitution must be ratified by the people and
submitted to Congress. If Congress shall approve it as
republican in form, and shall be satisfied that the people
of the State are loyal and well-disposed to the
Union, the State shall be restored to its former relations
and the provisional government shall cease.</p>

<p>Such is the bill which I should be glad to press upon
your attention, creating provisional governments and
securing permanent governments. It is not a military
bill; and on this account, in spirit and form, if not in
substance, it might be preferred to that which you have
begun to sanction. Besides, it contains abundant safeguards.
I regret much that something like this cannot
be adopted. It is with difficulty that I renounce
a desire long cherished to see Reconstruction under the
supervision of Congress, according to the forms of civil
order, without the intervention of military power. I am<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_334" id="Page_334">[Pg 334]</a></span>
sure that such a bill would be agreeable to the Unionists
of the Rebel States; and this with me is a rule
of conduct which I am unwilling to disregard. They
are without representation in Congress. Let us be their
representatives. I hear their voices gathered into one
prayer. I cannot refuse to listen.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>If this bill cannot be adopted, then I ask that you
shall take at least one of its provisions. Require free
schools as an essential condition of Reconstruction. But
I am met by the objection, that we are already concluded
by the Military Bill adopted a few days ago, so
that we cannot establish any new conditions. This is a
mistake. There is no word in the Military Bill which
can have this interpretation. Besides, the bill is only a
few days old; so that, whatever its character, nothing is
as yet fixed under its provisions. It contains no compact,
no promise, no vested right, nothing which may
not be changed, if the public interests require. There
are some who seem to insist that it is a strait-jacket.
On the contrary, this very bill asserts in positive terms
“the paramount authority of the United States.” Surely
this is enough. In the exercise of this authority, it is
your duty to provide all possible safeguards. To adopt
a familiar illustration, these States must be “bound to
keep the peace.” Nothing is more common after an
assault and battery. But this can be only by good
laws, by careful provisions, by wise economies, and
securities of all kinds.</p>

<p>Sometimes it is argued that it is not permissible to
make certain requirements in the new constitutions,
although, when the constitutions are presented to Congress
for approval, we may object to them for the want<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_335" id="Page_335">[Pg 335]</a></span>
of these very things. Thus it is said that we may not
require educational provisions, but that we may object
to the constitutions, when formed, if they fail to have
this safeguard. This argument forgets the paramount
power of Congress over the Rebel States, which you
have already exercised in ordaining universal suffrage.
Who can doubt, that, with equal reason, you may ordain
universal education also? And permit me to say that
one is the complement of the other. But I do not stop
with assertion of the power. The argument that we are
to wait until the constitution is submitted for approval
is not frank. I wish to be plain and explicit. We
have the power, assured by reason and precedent. Exercise
it. Seize the present moment. Grasp the precious
privilege. There are some who act on the principle of
doing as little as possible. I would do as much as possible,
believing that all we do in the nature of safeguard
must redound to the good of all and to the national
fame. It is in this spirit that I now move to
require a system of free schools, open to all without distinction
of caste. For this great safeguard I ask your
votes.</p>

<p>You have prescribed universal suffrage. Prescribe
now universal education. The power of Congress is the
same in one case as in the other. And you are under
an equal necessity to employ it. Electors by the hundred
thousand will exercise the franchise for the first
time, without delay or preparation. They should be
educated promptly. Without education your beneficent
legislation may be a failure. The gift you bestow will
be perilous. I was unwilling to make education the
condition of suffrage; but I ask that it shall accompany
and sustain suffrage.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_336" id="Page_336">[Pg 336]</a></span></p>

<p>Mr. President, I plead now for Education. Nothing
more beautiful or more precious. Education decorates
life, while it increases all our powers. It is the charm
of society, the solace of solitude, and the multiple of
every faculty. It adds incalculably to the capacity of
the individual and to the resources of the community.
Careful inquiry establishes what reason declares, that
labor is productive in proportion to its education. There
is no art it does not advance. There is no form of enterprise
it does not encourage and quicken. It brings
victory, and is itself the greatest of victories.</p>

<p>In a republic education is indispensable. A republic
without education is like the creature of imagination, a
human being without a soul, living and moving blindly,
with no just sense of the present or the future. It is a
monster. Such have been the Rebel States,&mdash;for years
nothing less than political monsters. But such they
must be no longer.</p>

<p>It is not too much to say, that, had these States been
more enlightened, they would never have rebelled. The
barbarism of Slavery would have shrunk into insignificance,
without sufficient force to break forth in blood.
From the returns before the Rebellion<a name="FNanchor_96_96" id="FNanchor_96_96"></a><a href="#Footnote_96_96" class="fnanchor">[96]</a> we learn that in
the Slave States there were not less than 493,026 native
white persons over twenty years of age who could not
read and write,&mdash;while in the Free States, with double
the native white population, there were but 248,725
native whites over twenty years of age thus blighted by
ignorance. In the Slave States the proportion was 1 in
5; in the Free States it was 1 in 22. The number in
Free Massachusetts, with an adult native white population
of 470,375, was 1,055, or 1 in 446; the number in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_337" id="Page_337">[Pg 337]</a></span>
Slave South Carolina, with an adult native white population
of only 120,136, was 15,580, or 1 in 8. The number
in Free Connecticut was 1 in 256, in Slave Virginia
1 in 5; in Free New Hampshire 1 in 192, and in Slave
North Carolina 1 in 3. In this prevailing ignorance
we may trace the Rebellion. A population that could
not read and write naturally failed to comprehend and
appreciate a republican government.</p>

<p>This contrast between the Rebel States and the Loyal
States appeared early. It was conspicuous in two Colonies,
each of which exercised a peculiar influence.
Massachusetts began her existence with a system of
free schools. The preamble of her venerable statute
deserves immortality. “That learning may not be buried
in the grave of our fathers,” her founders enacted
that every township of fifty householders should maintain
a school for reading and writing, and every town
of a hundred householders a school to fit youths for the
University.<a name="FNanchor_97_97" id="FNanchor_97_97"></a><a href="#Footnote_97_97" class="fnanchor">[97]</a> This statute was copied in other Colonies.
It has spread far, like a benediction. At the same time
Virginia set herself openly against free schools. Her
Governor, Sir William Berkeley, in 1671, in a reply to
the Lords Commissioners of Plantations on the condition
of the Colony, made this painful record: “I thank
God <em>there are no free schools</em>, nor printing, and I hope
we shall not have these hundred years; for learning
has brought disobedience and heresy and sects into the
world, and printing has divulged them.… God keep
us from both!”<a name="FNanchor_98_98" id="FNanchor_98_98"></a><a href="#Footnote_98_98" class="fnanchor">[98]</a> Thus spoke Massachusetts, and thus
spoke Virginia, in that ancient day. The conflict of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_338" id="Page_338">[Pg 338]</a></span>
ideas had already begun. Can you hesitate to adopt the
statute so well justified by time? It began in an infant
colony. Let it be the law of a mighty republic.</p>

<p>The papers of the day mention an incident, showing
how the original spirit of the Virginia Governor still
animates these States. A motion to print two hundred
copies of the Report of the State Superintendent of
Public Education was promptly voted down in the Senate
of Louisiana, while a Senator, in open speech, “denounced
the public education scheme as an unmitigated
oppression, an electioneering device, an imposition,
which he intended to bring in a bill to abolish, if
they were allowed to go on legislating.” With such
brutality is this beautiful cause now encountered. It
is as if a savage rudely drove an angel from his tent.</p>

<p>Be taught by this example, and do not hesitate, I
entreat you. Remember how much is now in issue.
You are to fix the securities of the future, and especially
to see that a republican government is guarantied
in an the Rebel States. I call them “Rebel,” for such
they are in spirit still, and such is their designation in
your recent statute. But I ask nothing in vengeance
or unkindness. All that I propose is for their good,
with which is intertwined the good of all. I would
not impose any new penalty or bear hard upon an erring
people. Oh, no! I simply ask a new safeguard for
the future, that these States, through which so much
trouble has come, may be a strength and a blessing to
our common country, with prosperity and happiness
everywhere within their borders. I would not impose
any new burden; but I seek a new triumph for civilization.
For a military occupation bristling with bayonets
I would substitute the smile of peace. But this<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_339" id="Page_339">[Pg 339]</a></span>
cannot be without Education. As the soldier disappears,
his place must be supplied by the schoolmaster. The
muster-roll will be exchanged for the school-register,
and our headquarters will be a school-house.</p>

<p>Do not forget the grandeur of the work in which
you are engaged. You are forming States. Such a
work cannot be done hastily or carelessly. The time
you give will be saved to the country hereafter a thousand-fold.
The time you begrudge will rise in judgment
against you. It is a law of Nature, that, just in
proportion as the being produced is higher in the scale
and more complete in function, all the processes are
more complex and extended. The mature liberty we
seek cannot have the easy birth of feebler types. As
man, endowed with reason and looking to the heavens,
is above the quadruped that walks, above the bird that
flies, above the fish that swims, and above the worm
that crawls, so should these new governments, republican
in form and loyal in soul, created by your care,
be above those whose places they take. The Old must
give way to the New, and the New must be worthy
of a Republic, which, ransomed from Slavery, has become
an example to mankind. Farewell to the Old!
All hail to the New!</p>

<p>Mr. Frelinghuysen, of New Jersey, Mr. Stewart, of Nevada, and Mr.
Conness, of California, joined in criticism of Mr. Sumner’s opposition to
the employment of the military arm in Reconstruction, protesting particularly
against the declaration that States are “about to be born of
the bayonet.” To the proposed requirement of a system of free schools
in the Rebel States Mr. Frelinghuysen objected: “For us to undertake
now to add new conditions to the Reconstruction measure which
the Thirty-Ninth Congress adopted I hold to be bad faith.… That
is not the way to do business.… Let this nation keep its faith. I
hope, Mr. President, that the amendment will not be adopted.” Mr.
Patterson, of New Hampshire, would “be glad to have such a requisition<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_340" id="Page_340">[Pg 340]</a></span>
laid on all the States of the Union, if it were not unconstitutional.
But he wished to ask him [Mr. <span class="smcap">Sumner</span>] this question: Does
he think it possible to establish a system of common schools in these
Southern States corresponding to the common-school system of New
England, unless he first confiscates the large estates and divides them
into small homesteads, so that there may be small landholders who
shall support these schools by the taxation which is laid upon them?”</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Sumner.</span> I do.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Patterson.</span> You think it is possible?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Sumner.</span> I do, certainly,&mdash;most clearly.</p>

</div>

<p>Mr. Morton said: “The proposition is fundamental in its character;
its importance cannot be overestimated; and I hope that it will be
placed as a condition, upon complying with which they shall be permitted
to return.” Mr. Cole, of California, declared himself “warmly
in favor of the amendment.” Mr. Hendricks, of Indiana, and Mr.
Buckalew, of Pennsylvania, both Democrats, spoke against it. The
latter thought Mr. Sumner “not open to criticism for the sentiments
which he has expressed upon this occasion, nor for the position which
he has assumed.” In a humorous vein, he said: “The propositions
which the Senator from Massachusetts makes one year, and which are
criticized by his colleagues as extreme, inappropriate, and untimely,
are precisely the propositions which those colleagues support with
greater zeal and vehemence, if possible, than he, the year following.
In short, Sir, we can foresee at one session of Congress the character
of the propositions and of the arguments with which we are to be
favored at the next in this Chamber, by looking to the pioneer man,
who goes forward in advance, his banner thrown out, his cause announced,
the means by which it shall be carried on and the objects
in view proclaimed with force and frankness.”</p>

<p>Mr. Sumner replied:&mdash;</p>

</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. President</span>,&mdash;The question of power, I take it,
must be settled in this Chamber. You have already
most solemnly voted to require in every new constitution
suffrage for all, without distinction of race or color
or previous condition. But the greater contains the
less. If you can do that, you can do everything. If
you can require that Magna Charta of human rights,
you can require what is smaller. It is already fixed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_341" id="Page_341">[Pg 341]</a></span>
in your statutes, enrolled in your archives, that Congress
has this great power. I do not say whether it
has this power over other States; that is not the question;
but it has the power over the Rebel States. That
power is derived from several sources,&mdash;first, from the
necessity of the case, because the State governments
there are illegal, and the whole region has passed, as
in the case of Territories, under the jurisdiction of Congress:
no legal government exists there, except what
Congress supplies. There is another source in the military
power now established over that region; then,
again, in that great clause of the National Constitution
by which you are required to guaranty to every State a
republican form of government. Here is enough. Out
of these three sources, these three overflowing fountains,
springs ample authority. You have exercised it by prescribing
in their constitutions Suffrage for all. I ask
you to go one step further, and to prescribe Education
for all.</p>

<p>I am met here by personal objections; I am asked
why I have not brought this forward before. Sir, I
have brought it forward in season and out of season.
I have on the table before me a speech of mine in
1865, where, in laying down the great essential guaranties,
I declared them as follows: First, the unity
of the Republic; secondly, Enfranchisement; thirdly,
the guaranty of the National debt; fourthly, the repudiation
of the Rebel debt; fifthly, Equal Suffrage; and,
sixthly, Education of the people.<a name="FNanchor_99_99" id="FNanchor_99_99"></a><a href="#Footnote_99_99" class="fnanchor">[99]</a> Therefore from the
beginning I have asked this guaranty, believing, as I
do most clearly, that under the National Constitution<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_342" id="Page_342">[Pg 342]</a></span>
you may demand it. If you may demand it, if you
have the power, then do I insist it is your duty so to
do. Duties are in proportion to powers. These great
powers are not merely for display or idleness, but for
employment, to the end that the Republic may be advanced
and fortified.</p>

<p>Then I have been reminded very earnestly by Senators
that I have used strong language in saying that
these governments will be open to the imputation of
being born of the bayonet. This is not the first time
I have used that language in this Chamber. From the
beginning I have protested against Reconstruction by
military power. Again and again I have asserted that
it is contrary to the genius of republican institutions,
and to a just economy of political forces. I have not
been hearkened to. Others have pressed the intervention
of military power; and now, as I am about to
record my vote in favor of the pending proposition, I
cannot but express my sincere and unfeigned regret
that Congress did not see its way to a generous measure
of Reconstruction purely civil in character, having
no element of military power. Such you had before
you at the last session in the Louisiana Bill, which I
sought to press day by day; and when, at the last
moment, the Military Bill was passed, I, from my
place here, declared that I should deem it my duty at
the earliest possible moment in this session to press
the Louisiana Bill, or some kindred measure not military
in character.</p>

<p>I was early tutored in the principles of Jefferson.
I cannot forget his Inaugural Address, where he lays
down among the cardinal principles, or what he calls
“the essential principles of our Government,” and consequently<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_343" id="Page_343">[Pg 343]</a></span>
those which ought to shape its administration,
“The supremacy of the civil over the military authority.”
Imbued with this principle, I hoped that Congress
would see the way to establish at once civil governments
in all those States, and not subject them to
military power, except so far as needed for purposes
of protection. This is the true object of the army. It
is to protect the country,&mdash;not to make constitutions,
or to superintend the making of constitutions. At least,
so I have read the history of republican institutions,
and such are the aspirations that I presume to express
for my country.</p>

<p class="plabeln"><span class="smcap">Speech in the Senate, on a Joint Resolution concerning the
Uniform of Persons in the Diplomatic Service of the United

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/line.png" width="80" height="16" alt="" />
</div>

<div class="medium">

<p>March 20th, Mr. Summer, from the Committee on Foreign Relations,
reported the following joint resolution:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“<i>Resolved, &amp;c.</i>, That all persons in the diplomatic service of the United
States are prohibited from wearing any uniform or official costume not
previously authorized by Congress.”</p>

</div>

<p>He then stated that it was reported from the Committee unanimously,
and that perhaps the Senate would be willing to consider it
at once. The resolution was proceeded with by unanimous consent,
when Mr. Sherman, of Ohio, remarked: “I do not see what right
we have to prevent a minister abroad from wearing the uniform of our
army, if he chooses.” Mr. Sumner replied:&mdash;</p>

</div>

<p class="dropcap">The Senator is aware that a habit exists among our
ministers in Europe of wearing uniforms of other
countries in the nature of court costumes or dresses;
and this is often required before they are presented.
The Committee on Foreign Relations, after careful consideration,
have unanimously come to the conclusion
that it is expedient to prohibit any such uniform or official
costume, unless sanctioned previously by Act of
Congress. It seems clear that our ministers abroad
should not be required by any foreign government to
wear a uniform, costume, or dress unknown to our own
laws. This is very simple, and not unreasonable.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_345" id="Page_345">[Pg 345]</a></span></p>

<p>This question is perhaps more important than it appears.
On its face it is of form only, or rather of dress,
proper for the learned in Carlyle’s “Sartor Resartus.”
But I am not sure that it does not concern the character
of the Republic. Shall our ministers abroad be required
by any foreign government to assume a uniform unknown
to our laws? Ministers of other countries appear
at foreign courts in the dress they would wear before
the sovereign at home. What is good enough for
the sovereign at home is, I understand, good enough for
other sovereigns. And surely the dress in which one
of our ministers would appear before the President of
the United States ought to be sufficient anywhere. Its
simplicity is to my mind no argument against it.</p>

<p>It is sometimes said, gravely enough, that, if our ministers
appear in the simple dress of a citizen, according
to the requirement of Mr. Marcy’s famous circular, they
may be mistaken for “upper servants.” If such be the
case, they will have little of the stamp of fitness. I am
not troubled on this head. Their simplicity would be
a distinction, and it would be typical of the republican
government they represent. Amidst the brilliant dresses
and fantastic uniforms of European courts a simple
dress would be most suggestive. A British minister
appearing at the Congress of Vienna in simple black,
with a single star on his breast, so contrasted with the
bedizened crowd about him as to awaken the admiration
of an illustrious prince, who exclaimed, “How distinguished!”</p>

<p>This is an old subject, which I trust may be disposed
of at last. Mr. Marcy enjoined simplicity in the official
dress of our foreign representatives, and dwelt with pride
on the well-known example of Benjamin Franklin. But<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_346" id="Page_346">[Pg 346]</a></span>
his instructions were not sufficiently explicit, and they
were allowed to die out. Some appeared in simple
black, and were not mistaken for “upper servants.”
But gold lace at last carried the day, and our representatives
now appear in a costume peculiar to European
courts. A simple prohibition by Congress will put an
end to this petty complication, and make it easy for
them to follow abroad the simple ways to which they
have been accustomed at home.</p>

<div class="medium">

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Sherman.</span> All I wish to know is, whether General
Dix, or any other minister, could wear the uniform of our
army, if he chose. The rule, if I understand it, in some foreign
countries, is, that a person must appear at court in some
kind of uniform. If none is provided by his government, or
authorized by his government, then he adopts a certain uniform
according to the custom of the country to which he is
accredited. Perhaps, however, I am not correct.</p>

</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Sumner.</span> The object of the pending measure is
to encounter that precise requirement of foreign governments,
and to put our ministers on an equality with
those of other countries. I have already said that ministers
of other countries may appear at the courts to
which they are addressed as they would appear before
their own sovereign. I take it the Turkish ambassador
is not obliged to assume in Paris or London any official
costume peculiar to France or England; but he appears,
as at a reception by his own sovereign, with the fez on
his head. And so the Austrian ambassador appears in
his fantastic Hungarian jacket. But I see no reason
why there should be one rule for these ambassadors, and
another for the representatives of the American Republic.
Here, as elsewhere, there should be equality. The equality
of nations is a first principle of International Law.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_347" id="Page_347">[Pg 347]</a></span>
But this is offended by any requirement of a foreign government
which shall not leave our representative free
to appear before the sovereign of the country to which
he is accredited as he would before the Chief Magistrate
of the American people,&mdash;in other words, in the simple
dress of an American citizen. This is the whole case.</p>

<div class="medium">

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Sherman.</span> The Senator does not yet answer my question:
Will this prevent an American minister abroad from
wearing the uniform of an officer of the army of the United
States, such as he would be entitled to wear under our laws,
if here?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Sumner.</span> If entitled under our laws, there could be
no difficulty.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Sherman.</span> We have a law which authorizes a volunteer
officer who has attained the rank of a brigadier-general,
for instance, always on state occasions to wear that uniform.</p>

</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Sumner.</span> There can be no misunderstanding.
The ministers are simply to follow Congress; and as
Congress has not authorized any uniform or official costume,
they can have none, unless they come within the
exceptional case to which the Senator has alluded. Certain
persons who have been in the military service are
authorized, under an existing Act of Congress, to wear
their military uniform on public occasions. This resolution
cannot interfere in any way with that provision.
It leaves the Act of Congress in full force, and is applicable
only to those not embraced by that Act.</p>

<div class="medium">

<p>The joint resolution passed the Senate without a division. March
25th, it passed the House without a division, and was approved by

<p>March 23d, Mr. Trumbull, of Illinois, offered a resolution adjourning
the two Houses on Tuesday, March 26th, at twelve o’clock, noon,
until the first Monday of December, at twelve o’clock, noon. Mr.
Drake, of Missouri, moved to amend by striking out “the first Monday
of December,” and inserting “Tuesday, the 15th day of October.”
This amendment was rejected,&mdash;Yeas 19, Nays 28. Mr. Morrill, of
Vermont, then moved to amend by inserting “first Monday of November,”
and this amendment was rejected,&mdash;Yeas 18, Nays 27. Mr.

of June, and that on that day, unless then otherwise ordered
by the two Houses, until the first Monday of December. This was
rejected,&mdash;Yeas 14, Nays 31. The question then recurred on the
resolution of Mr. Trumbull. A debate ensued, in which Mr. Sumner
said:&mdash;</p>

</div>

<p class="dropcap">I am against the resolution. In my opinion, Congress
ought not to adjourn and go home without
at least some provision for return to our post. As
often as I think of this question, I am met by two
controlling facts. I speak now of facts which stare us
in the face.</p>

<p>You must not forget that the President is a bad
man, the author of incalculable woe to his country,
and especially to that part which, being most tried by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_349" id="Page_349">[Pg 349]</a></span>
war, most needed kindly care. Search history, and I
am sure you will find no elected ruler who, during the
same short time, has done so much mischief to his
country. He stands alone in bad eminence. Nobody
in ancient or modern times can be his parallel. Alone
in the evil he has done, he is also alone in the maudlin
and frantic manner he has adopted. Look at his acts,
and read his speeches. This is enough.</p>

<p>Such is the fact. And now I ask, Can Congress
quietly vote to go home and leave such a man without
hindrance? These scenes are historic. His conduct
is historic. Permit me to remind you that your
course with regard to him will be historic. It can
never be forgotten, if you keep your seats and meet
the usurper face to face,&mdash;as it can never be forgotten,
if, leaving your seats, you let him remain master to do
as he pleases. Most of all, he covets your absence.
Do not indulge him.</p>

<p>Then comes the other controlling fact. There is at
this moment a numerous population, counted by millions,&mdash;call
it, if you please, eight millions,&mdash;looking
to Congress for protection. Of this large population,
all the loyal people stretch out their hands to Congress.
They ask you to stay. They know by instinct that so
long as you remain in your seats they are not without
protection. They have suffered through the President,
who, when they needed bread, has given them
a stone, and when they needed peace, has given them
strife. They have seen him offer encouragement to
Rebels, and even set the Rebellion on its legs. Their
souls have been wrung as they beheld fellow-citizens
brutally sacrificed, whose only crime was that they loved
the Union. Sometimes the sacrifice was on a small<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_350" id="Page_350">[Pg 350]</a></span>
scale, and sometimes by wholesale. Witness Memphis;
witness New Orleans; ay, Sir, witness the whole broad
country from the Potomac to the Rio Grande.</p>

<p>With a Presidential usurper menacing the Republic,
and with a large population, counted by millions, looking
to Congress for protection, I dare not vote to go
home. It is my duty to stay here. I am sure that
our presence here will be an encouragement and a comfort
to loyal people throughout these troubled States.
They will feel that they are not left alone with their
deadly enemy. Home is always tempting. It is pleasant
to escape from care. But duty is more than home
or any escape from care. As often as I think of these
temptations, I feel their insignificance by the side of
solemn obligations. There is the President: he must
be watched and opposed. There is an oppressed people:
it must be protected. But this cannot be done
without effort on the part of Congress. “Eternal vigilance
is the price of liberty.” Never was there more
need for this vigilance than now.</p>

<p>An admirable and most suggestive engraving has
been placed on our tables to-day, in “Harper’s Weekly,”<a name="FNanchor_102_102" id="FNanchor_102_102"></a><a href="#Footnote_102_102" class="fnanchor">[102]</a>
where President Johnson is represented as a Roman
emperor presiding in the amphitheatre with imperatorial
pomp, and surrounded by trusty counsellors,
among whom it is easy to distinguish the Secretary of
State and the Secretary of the Navy, looking with complacency
at the butchery below. The victims are black,
and their sacrifice, as gladiators, makes a “Roman holiday.”
Beneath the picture is written, “Amphitheatrum
Johnsonianum&mdash;Massacre of the Innocents at New Orleans,
July 30, 1866.” This inscription tells the terrible<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_351" id="Page_351">[Pg 351]</a></span>
story. The bloody scene is before you. The massacre
proceeds under patronage of the President. His Presidential
nod is law. At his will blood spurts and men
bite the dust. But this is only a single scene in one
place. Wherever in the Rebel States there is a truly
loyal citizen, loving the Union, there is a victim who
may be called to suffer at any moment from the distempered
spirit which now rules. I speak according
to the evidence. This whole country is an “Amphitheatrum
Johnsonianum,” where the victims are counted
by the thousand. To my mind, there is no duty more
urgent than to guard against this despot, and be ready
to throw the shield of Congress over loyal citizens whom
he delivers to sacrifice.</p>

<p>The resolution of Mr. Trumbull was agreed to,&mdash;Yeas 29, Nays 16.</p>

<p>March 25th, on motion of Mr. Wilson, of Massachusetts, the resolution
was returned from the House of Representatives for reconsideration.
Meanwhile the House adopted the following resolution,
which was laid before the Senate:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“That the Senate and House of Representatives do hereby each give
consent to the other that each House of Congress shall adjourn the present
session from the hour of twelve o’clock, meridian, on Thursday next,
the 28th day of March instant, to assemble again on the first Wednesday
of May, the first Wednesday of June, the first Wednesday of September,
and the first Wednesday of November, of this year, unless the President
of the Senate <i>pro tempore</i> and the Speaker of the House of Representatives
shall by joint proclamation, to be issued by them ten days before
either of the times herein fixed for assembling, declare that there is
no occasion for the meeting of Congress at such time.”</p>

</div>

<p>On motion of Mr. Fessenden, this resolution was referred to the
Committee on the Judiciary.</p>

<p>March 26th, the House resolution was reported by Mr. Trumbull,
with a substitute adjourning the two Houses “on the 28th instant,
at twelve o’clock, meridian.” Debate ensued, when Mr. Howe, of
Wisconsin, moved an adjournment on the 29th of March until the
first Monday of June, and on that day, unless then otherwise ordered
by the two Houses, until the first Monday of December. After debate,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_352" id="Page_352">[Pg 352]</a></span>
this amendment was rejected,&mdash;Yeas 17, Nays 25. Mr. Morrill,
of Vermont, moved to amend the substitute of the Committee by adding
“to meet again on the first Monday of November next,” which
was rejected,&mdash;Yeas 16, Nays 25. Mr. Sumner then moved to amend
the substitute by adding:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“<i>Provided</i>, That the President of the Senate <i>pro tempore</i> and the
Speaker of the House of Representatives may by joint proclamation, at
any time before the first Monday of December, convene the two Houses
of Congress for the transaction of business, if in their opinion the public
interests require.”</p>

</div>

<p>Here he said:&mdash;</p>

</div>

<p>I am unwilling to doubt that Congress may authorize
their officers to do that. I cannot doubt it. Assuming
that we have the power, is not this an occasion
to exercise it? I do not wish to be carried into
the general debate. I had intended to say something
about it; but it is late.… I will not, therefore, go
into the general question, except to make one remark:
I do think Congress ought to do something; we ought
not to adjourn as on ordinary occasions,&mdash;for this is
not an ordinary occasion, and there is the precise beginning
of the difference between myself and the Senator
from Maine, and also between myself and the Senator
from Illinois.</p>

<p>The Senator from Illinois said, Why not, as on ordinary
occasions, now go home? Ay, Sir, that is the
very question. Is this an ordinary occasion? To my
mind, it clearly is not. It is an extraordinary occasion,
big with the fate of this Republic.</p>

<div class="medium">

<p>The amendment of Mr. Sumner was rejected,&mdash;Yeas 15, Nays 26.
Mr. Howe then moved to insert “Friday, the 29th,” instead of “Thursday,
the 28th,” which was rejected. Mr. Drake then moved an amendment,
28th March until 5th June, when, unless a quorum of both
Houses were present, the presiding officers should adjourn until 4th
September, when, unless a quorum of both Houses were present, they
should adjourn until the first Monday of December. This also was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_353" id="Page_353">[Pg 353]</a></span>
rejected,&mdash;Yeas 14, Nays 27. The substitute reported by Mr. Trumbull
was then agreed to,&mdash;Yeas 21, Nays 17. The other House then
adopted a substitute, adjourning March 28th to the first Wednesday of
June, and to the first Wednesday of September, unless the presiding
officers, by joint proclamation ten days before either of these times,
should declare that there was no occasion for the meeting of Congress
at that time. In the Senate, March 28th, Mr. Edmunds, of Vermont,
moved a substitute, adjourning March 30th to the first Wednesday of
July, and then, unless otherwise ordered by both Houses, on the next
day adjourning without day.</p>

<p>Mr. Sumner said:&mdash;</p>

</div>

<p>The Senate seems to have arrived at a point where
the difference is one of form rather than substance. We
have been occupied almost an hour in discussing the
phraseology of the resolution. We have reached the
great point which was the subject of such earnest discussion
two or three days ago, that Congress ought in some
way or other to secure to itself the power of meeting
during the long period between now and next December.
I understand Senators are all agreed on that. I
am glad of it. Only by time and discussion we have
reached that harmony. The House has given us three
opportunities. The old story is repeated. The Senate, so
far as I can understand, is ready to adopt the proposition
of the House,&mdash;substantially I mean, for this proposition,
as I understand it, is simply to secure for Congress an
opportunity of coming together during the summer and
autumn. Now the practical question is, How shall this
be best accomplished? I am ready to accept either of
the forms. I am willing to accept the form last adopted
by the House. I do not see that that is objectionable.
I am ready, if I can get nothing better, to accept the
form proposed by the Senator from Vermont; but I
must confess that the form proposed by the Senator from
Missouri seems briefer, clearer, better. If I could have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_354" id="Page_354">[Pg 354]</a></span>
my own way, I would set aside the proposition of the
Senator from Vermont, and fall back upon that of the
Senator from Missouri, as better expressing the conclusion
which I am glad to see at last reached.</p>

<p>I believe it is settled that we shall not adjourn to-morrow.
Am I right?</p>

<div class="medium">

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Edmunds.</span> Yes, Sir.</p>

</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Sumner.</span> I am glad of it. That is the gain of a
day. We were to adjourn to-day at twelve o’clock, and
then again to-morrow at twelve o’clock, and now it is
put off until Saturday. I cannot doubt that the Senate
would do much better, if it put off the adjournment
until next week. There is important business on your
table, which ought to be considered.</p>

<div class="medium">

<p>Mr. Sumner then called attention to measures deserving consideration,
and continued:&mdash;</p>

</div>

<p>Here is another measure, which I once characterized
as an effort to cut the Gordian knot of the suffrage question.
It is a bill introduced by myself to carry out various
constitutional provisions securing political rights
in all our States, precisely as we have already secured
civil rights. The importance of this bill cannot be exaggerated.
There is not a Senator who does not know
the anxious condition of things in the neighboring State
of Maryland for want of such a bill. Let Congress interfere
under the National Constitution, and exercise a
power clearly belonging to it, settling this whole suffrage
question, so that it shall no longer agitate the politics
of the States, no longer be the occasion of dissension,
possibly of bloodshed, in Maryland or in Delaware, or
of difference in Ohio. Let us settle the question before
we return home.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_355" id="Page_355">[Pg 355]</a></span></p>

<p>When I rose, I had no purpose of calling attention to
these measures. My special object was to express satisfaction
that the Senate at last is disposed to harmonize
with the other House on the important question of securing
to Congress the power of meeting during the
summer and autumn. That is a great point gained for
the peace and welfare of the country. Without it you
will leave the country a prey to the President; you will
leave our Union friends throughout the South a sacrifice
to the same malignant usurper.</p>

<div class="medium">

<p>The substitute proposed by Mr. Edmunds was agreed to,&mdash;Yeas 25,
Nays 14. The House non-concurring, it was referred to a committee
of conference.</p>

<p>March 29th, another resolution having been meanwhile adopted by
the House, providing for an adjournment to the first Wednesday of
June, and then, if a quorum of both Houses were not present, to the
first Wednesday of September, and then, in the absence of a quorum,
to the first Monday of December, Mr. Edmunds moved the following
substitute:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“The President of the Senate and the Speaker of the House of Representatives
are hereby directed to adjourn their respective Houses on
Saturday, March 30, 1867, at twelve o’clock, meridian, to the first Wednesday
of July, 1867, at noon, when the roll of each House shall be immediately
called, and immediately thereafter the presiding officer of each
House shall cause the presiding officer of the other House to be informed
whether or not a quorum of its body has appeared; and thereupon, if a
quorum of the two Houses respectively shall not have appeared upon such
call of the rolls, the President of the Senate and the Speaker of the House
of Representatives shall immediately adjourn their respective Houses without
day.”</p>

</div>

<p>Mr. Sumner said:&mdash;</p>

</div>

<p>I am against the amendment on two grounds: first,
that it proposes to adjourn too soon; and, secondly, that
it superfluously and unnecessarily makes a new difference
with the House of Representatives. In the first
place, it proposes to adjourn too soon,&mdash;that is, to-morrow<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_356" id="Page_356">[Pg 356]</a></span>
at twelve o’clock. The business of the country will
suffer by adjournment at that time. We are now in
currents of business that recall the last days of regular
sessions, or the rapids that precede a cataract. Senators
are straggling for the floor, and perhaps are not
always amiable, if they do not obtain it. We ought to
give time for all this important business, so that there
be no such unseemly struggle.</p>

<p>The calendar of the Senate shows one hundred and
fifteen bills now on your table from the Senate alone,
of which only a small portion have been considered;
and looking at the House calendar, I find one of their
late bills numbered one hundred and two, showing that
very large number, of which you have considered thus
far only a very small proportion. I do not ask attention
to these numerous bills, but unquestionably among
them are many of great importance. There are two especially
to which I have already referred, and to which
I mean to call your attention, so long as you sit as a
Congress, and down to the last moment, unless they shall
be acted on. I mean, in the first place, the bill providing
for a change in the time of electing a mayor and
other officers in the city of Washington. Congress
ought not to go home leaving this question unsettled.</p>

<p>You have bestowed the suffrage upon the colored people
here, and they are about to exercise it in choosing
aldermen and a common council; but those aldermen
and common councilmen will find themselves presided
over by a mayor chosen by a different constituency, and
hostile to them in sentiment, one possessing sometimes
the veto power, and always a very considerable influence,
which he will naturally exercise against this new
government. Will you leave Washington subject to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_357" id="Page_357">[Pg 357]</a></span>
such discord? Will you consent that the votes of the
colored people shall be thus neutralized the first time
they are called into exercise? I trust Congress will not
adjourn until this important bill is acted upon. It is
very simple; it need not excite discussion; it is practical.
Let it be read at the table, and every Senator will
understand it, and will be ready to vote upon it without
argument. Thus far I have not been able to bring it
before the Senate, though I have tried day by day. I
have not yet been able to have it read.</p>

<div class="medium">

<p>Mr. Sumner then referred again to the bill securing the elective franchise
throughout the country, vindicating its constitutionality and necessity.</p>

<p>Mr. Wilson then moved to amend by making the day of adjournment
the 10th of April; but this was rejected,&mdash;Yeas 13, Nays 28.
Mr. Sumner then moved to amend by inserting “five o’clock, Saturday
afternoon,” instead of “twelve o’clock, noon,” saying, “so that we
shall have five hours more for work”; but this, modified by the substitution
of four o’clock, was likewise rejected.</p>

<p>The substitute of Mr. Edmunds was then adopted,&mdash;Yeas 28, Nays
12,&mdash;Mr. Sumner voting in the negative. The House concurred, and
the adjournment took place accordingly.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>In this episode began the differences with regard to President Johnson.
To protect good people against him was the object of the
earnest effort to prolong the session and to provide for an intermediate
session before the regular meeting of Congress. Among those who
voted for the adjournment were distinguished Senators who afterwards
voted for his acquittal, when impeached at the bar of the Senate.</p>

<p class="plabeln"><span class="smcap">Remarks in the Senate, on a Joint Resolution authorizing Surveys
for the Reconstruction of the Levees of the Mississippi,
March 29, 1867.</span></p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/line.png" width="80" height="16" alt="" />
</div>

<div class="medium">

<p>March 29th, on motion of Mr. Sprague, of Rhode Island, the Senate
proceeded to consider a joint resolution directing an examination
and estimate to be made of the cost of reconstructing the levees of the
Mississippi. Mr. Sumner remarked that he was not against making
this exploration and inquiry,&mdash;that he welcomed anything of the
kind,&mdash;but he was anxious that Congress should not commit itself to
the expenditure involved. He therefore moved the following amendment:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“<i>Provided</i>, That it is understood in advance that no appropriations for
the levees of the Mississippi River shall be made in any State until after
the restoration of such State to the Union, with the elective franchise and
free schools without distinction of race or color.”</p>

</div>

<p>On this he remarked:&mdash;</p>

</div>

<p class="dropcap">I am unwilling that Congress should seem in any
way to commit itself to so great an expenditure in
one of these States, except with the distinct understanding
that it shall not be until after the restoration
of the State to the Union on those principles without
which the State will not be loyal or republican. We
are all seeking to found governments truly loyal and
truly republican. Will any Rebel State be such until it
has secured in its constitution the elective franchise to
all, and until it has opened free schools to all? The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_359" id="Page_359">[Pg 359]</a></span>
proposition is a truism. A State which does not give
the elective franchise to all, without distinction of color,
is not republican in form, and cannot be sanctioned as
such by the Congress of the United States. Now I am
anxious, so far as I can, to take a bond in advance, and
to hold out every temptation, every lure, every seduction
to tread the right path,&mdash;in other words, to tread
the path of loyalty and of republicanism. Therefore I
seize the present opportunity to let these States know
in advance, that, if they expect the powerful intervention
of Congress, they must qualify themselves to receive
it by giving evidence that they are truly loyal
and truly republican.</p>

<p>This is no common survey of a river or harbor.
The Senator from Maine [Mr. <span class="smcap">Morrill</span>] has already
pointed out the difference between the two cases. They
are wide apart. It is an immense charity, a benefaction,
from which private individuals are to gain largely.
Thus far these levees have always been built, as I understand,&mdash;I
am open to correction,&mdash;by the owners
of the lands, and by the States.</p>

<div class="medium">

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Stewart</span> [of Nevada]. And principally by the swamp
lands donated by Congress.</p>

</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Sumner.</span> Now it is proposed, for the first time,
that the National Government shall intervene with its
powerful aid. Are you ready to embark in that great
undertaking? I do not say that you should not, for
I am one who has never hesitated, and I do not mean
hereafter to hesitate, in an appropriation for the good
of any part of the country, if I can see that it is constitutional;
and on the question of constitutionality I
do not mean to be nice. I mean always to be generous<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_360" id="Page_360">[Pg 360]</a></span>
in interpretation of the Constitution, and in appropriations
for any such object; but I submit that Congress
shall not in any respect pledge itself to this undertaking,
involving such a lavish expenditure, except
on the fundamental condition that the States where the
money is to be invested shall be truly loyal and republican
in form; and I insist that not one of those States
can be such, except on the conditions stated in my
amendment.</p>

<div class="medium">

<p>No vote was reached, and the joint resolution was never considered
again.</p>

agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See

States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE

received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person

violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the

limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or

the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
